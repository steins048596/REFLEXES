The patient first reported these worsening headaches to his primary care provider, Dr. Henry Howard, on 03/01/2023. The headaches were new for the patient and described as located behind the eyes, with a dull, nagging quality, worsening over the past three months. Initially, the pain severity was 3 out of 10, which has now escalated to a 6 out of 10. The headaches typically present in the morning, lasting for a few hours, with no identifiable triggers or alleviating factors. The patient denies any additional symptoms, including nausea, fever, rashes, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or syncope. However, he did mention recent incidents of bumping into door frames.\n\nOn further evaluation, a brain MRI revealed a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The patient's complete blood count, urea, coagulation, and C-reactive protein results were normal. However, his pituitary hormone profile showed a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nThe patient has no known chronic illnesses, takes no medications, and has no known familial history of disease due to his adoption.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient works as a computer programmer, is married for 25 years, and recently purchased a house. He denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substance use.\n\nEXAMINATION\n\nThe patient was alert, oriented, and had fluent speech. The cranial nerve examination was grossly intact with no focal, motor, or sensory deficits observed in the upper or lower extremities. Visual acuity and eye movements were normal, pupils were equal and reactive, but visual field testing revealed bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision was reported as normal.\n\nDIAGNOSIS\n\nPituitary adenoma.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nMr. Ward's condition presents as a benign appearing pituitary adenoma. The patient is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression due to the pituitary lesion. \n\nPLAN\n\nGiven the symptoms and the findings from the MRI, surgical intervention is recommended for excision and decompression of the pituitary fossa. The patient was informed about the transsphenoidal surgical approach and associated risks, including anesthesia, infection, need for further surgery, wound complications, seizures, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, and possible death. A pre-surgery visual field test was also planned for mapping peripheral vision, enabling post-surgery comparison and monitoring. The patient was referred to the surgery scheduler and to an ophthalmologist for a detailed eye examination. \n\nMr. Ward understands the need for surgery and is scheduled to meet with the surgery scheduler to plan the procedure. The patient will be encouraged to contact the clinic if he has further questions or concerns. End of note.",

The pain was centered behind her breastbone, sharp in nature, and exacerbated with eating. She also reported difficulty swallowing during this period. The patient had a negative workup in the ER including normal EKG and blood tests. She denies recurrent symptoms since that time. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n?

He denies any specific injury but has been quite active and has recently been doing a lot of work renovating his basement. He experiences significant pain when reaching, lifting, and attempting any overhead activities. The pain is constant and exacerbated by pressure, such as when lying on the left side at night. He has been taking extra strength Tylenol every six to eight hours which partially alleviates the pain.

Neurovascularly, the left arm is intact distally with a capillary refill of less than three seconds and intact sensation to light touch.\n\nRESULTS\n\nReview of the x-ray of the left shoulder revealed no fractures or bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft shoulder pain, likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter discussing with Wayne his current symptoms, physical examination and x-ray results, an MRI of the left shoulder is recommended to further investigate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy.

The issue is intermittent in nature, occurring less than once a day, often when she is walking. She describes the sensation as her knee \"giving out\" and sometimes feels as though she might fall, although she is able to catch herself. She has not experienced any particular trauma to the knee or heard any popping sounds. The discomfort is brief, subsiding as quickly as it begins, hence she has not felt the need to take any pain medication.

He complains of intermittent sharp pain localized on the right side of his abdomen below his ribs that radiates to his lower abdomen and into his groin. His symptoms started several days ago. He also reports dysuria (burning sensation during urination) and slightly darker urine, although he denies seeing frank blood in his urine. His pain is severe enough to cause discomfort, and over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol have provided little relief. The patient has a past medical history of kidney stones, which he successfully passed. He also mentions a family history of kidney stones with his father. He has been feeling nauseated but has not vomited, and denies any fever or chills.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right-side abdominal pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nVital signs are not mentioned in the dialogue and therefore cannot be commented upon.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right flank.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe CT scan ordered by the primary care physician revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nAcute nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) on the right side.\n\nPLAN\n\nWe reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. The plan is to manage the patient conservatively at this time. I have recommended increased fluid intake to facilitate urination and passing of the stone. I have prescribed oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain, and the patient can continue to alternate with Tylenol. The patient has been provided a strainer to use during urination to capture the stone if it passes. I have also ordered a Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP), urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection. The patient will follow up in 1 to 2 weeks. If his symptoms persist, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy or ureteroscopy.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient should contact the clinic if his symptoms worsen. He is to follow up in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress.",

He initially experienced burning and stinging sensations, and discovered a blister on the pad of the bottom of his foot, near his heel. \n\nOver time, he noticed a foul smell and yellow drainage from the site. After consultation with his primary care provider (PCP), the patient started antibiotic therapy six days ago. His symptoms include intermittent chills, a fever of around 99.7\u00b0F, and pain radiating up his calf. The patient reports that the ulcer site has turned black and the area is excessively hot. He has also experienced coughing and breathlessness over the past two days.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient has a medical history of well-controlled diabetes with an A1C of 6.7. He checks his blood sugar levels two to three times a day and has had blood sugar readings in the range of 300-400 mg/dl over the past two weeks, with a spike up to 500-600 mg/dl.

His antibiotic regimen will be continued, with potential changes or additions depending on the culture results.
