P: tylenol , but it really does n't seem to help .
D: yeah . okay . and do you have any blood in your urine ?
P: um , uh , it ... i think i do . it's kind of hard to detect , but it does look a little off-color .
D: okay . all right . um , and have you had , uh , any other symptoms like nausea and vomiting ?
P: um , if i'm doing something i'm ... i'm , uh , like exerting myself , like climbing the three flights of stairs to my apartment or running to catch the bus , i feel a little dizzy and a little light headed , and i ... i still feel a little bit more pain in my abdomen .
D: okay . all right . um , so let- let's talk a little bit about your ... your migraines . how are you doing with those ? i know we started you on the imitrex a couple months ago .
P: i've been pretty diligent about taking the meds . i ... i wan na make sure i stay on top of that , so i've been pretty good with that .
D: okay , so no issues with the migraine ?
P: none whatsoever .
D: okay . and how about your ... your acid reflux ? how are you doing with ... i know you were making some diet changes .
P: yeah , i've been pretty good with the diet , but with the pain i have been having, it has been easier to call and have something delivered. so i have been ordering a lot of take-out and fast food that can be delivered to my door so i don't have to go out and up and down the steps to get it myself. but other than that , it's been pretty good .
D: okay . are you staying hydrated ?
P: yes .
D: okay . all right . okay , well , let's go ahead and , uh , i know the nurse did a review of systems , you know , with you , and i know that you're endorsing some back pain and a little bit of dizziness , um , and some blood in your urine . any other symptoms ? you know , muscle aches , chest pain ... uh , body aches , anything like that ?
P: i have some body aches because i think i'm ... i'm favoring , um , my back when i'm walking because of the pain , like i kinda feel it in my muscles , but not out of the ordinary and not surprised 'cause i remember that from two years ago .
D: okay . all right . well , let's go ahead and ... and look at your vital signs today . hey , dragon ? show me the blood pressure . yeah , so your blood pressure's a little high today . that's probably because you're in some pain , um , but let ... let me just take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?
P: sure .
D: okay , so on ... on physical exam , you do have some , uh , cda tenderness on the right-hand side , meaning that you're tender when i ... when i pound on that .
P: mm-hmm .
D: um , and your abdomen also feels a little tender . you have some tenderness of the palpation of the right lower quadrant , but other than that , your heart sounds nice and clear and your lungs are clear as well . so let's go ahead and take a look at some of your results , okay ?
P: sure .
D: hey , dragon ? show me the creatinine . so we ... we drew a creatinine when you came in here because i was concerned about the kidney stones . it ... it is uh ... it is up slightly , which might suggest that you have a little bit of a obstruction there of one-
P: mm-hmm .
D: . of the stones . okay ? hey , dragon . show me the abdominal x-rays . okay , and there might be a question of a ... uh , of a stone there lower down , uh , but we'll wait for the official read there . so the , uh , abdominal x-rays show a possible kidney stone , okay ?
P: okay .
D: so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you . so , for your first problem , your back pain , i think you're having a recurrence of your kidney stones . so i wan na go ahead and order a ct scan without contrast of your abdomen and pelvis . okay ?
P: mm-hmm .
D: and i'm also gon na order you some ultram 50 milligrams as needed every six hours for pain . does that sound okay ?
P: okay .
D: hey , dragon ? order ultram 50 milligrams every six hours as needed for pain . and i want you to push fluids and strain your urine . i know that you're familiar with that .

P: no .
D: okay . and any family history of any heart disease ?
P: uh , no , actually . not , not on my , uh , uh , on my immediate family , but i have on my cousin's side of the family .
D: okay . all right . all right . and , um , you know , i know that you had had the , uh , knee surgery-
P: mm-hmm .
D: a couple months ago . you've been feeling well since then ?
P: yeah . no problem in , uh , rehab and recovery .
D: okay . and no chest pain while you were , you know , doing exercises in pt for your knee ?
P: no . that's why last week's episode was so surprising .
D: okay . all right . and in terms of your high blood pressure , do you know when you had the chest pain if your blood pressure was very high ? did they say anything in the emergency room ?
P: um , they were a little concerned about it , but , uh , they kept me there for a few hours and it seemed to regulate after effect . so , it , it did n't seem to be a problem when i , when i went home .
D: okay . and , and i see here that it was about 180 over 95 when you went into the emergency room . has it been running that high ?
P: uh , usually no . that's why it was so surprising .

P: um , for the most part , but we have been traveling all over to different sports tournaments for the kids , so it was , uh , a weekend of , uh , eating on the go , crumby junk food , pizza , and did n't really stick to the diet , so that was a bit of an adjustment .

DIALOGUE:
D: hi , louis . how are you ?
P: hi . good to see you .
D: it's good to see you as well . are you ready to get started ?
P: yes , i am .
D: louis is a 58-year-old male here for follow up from an emergency room visit . so , louis , what happened ?
P: yeah . i was playing tennis on saturday . it was really , really hot that day , very humid . and about after about a half an hour i was very short of breath , i was struggling breathing . i thought i was having a heart attack , got really nervous . so , my wife took me to the er and , uh , everything checked out , but i was just very upset about it .
D: okay . all right . and how have you been feeling since that time ?
P: uh , foof , probably , probably about six hours after we got home , i felt very light-head and very dizzy and then , sunday , i felt fine . i just thought it was worth checking up with you though .
D: okay . and have you been taking all of your meds for your heart failure ?
P: i have . i have . i've been , uh , very diligent with it . and , uh , i'm in touch with the doctor and so far , so good , other than this episode on saturday .
D: okay . and , and you're watching your diet , you're avoiding salt . have you had anything salty ?
P: i cheat every now and then . you know , i try and stay away from the junk food and the salty foods . but , for the most part , i've been doing a good job of that .
D: okay . all right . um , and i know that they removed a cataract from your eye-
P: mm-hmm .
D: . a couple of , like couple months ago . that's been fine ?
P: that was three months ago , thursday , and everything's been fine ever since .
D: okay . so , no vision problems .
P: no .
D: okay . and you had a skin cancer removed about five months ago as well . you've had a lot going on .
P: yeah . it's been a really busy year . an- and again , so far , so good . that healed up nicely , no problems ever since .
D: okay . all right . um , so , why do n't we go ahead and we'll do a quick physical-
P: mm-hmm .
D: . exam . hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . so , here , your blood pressure is a little high .
P: mm-hmm .
D: um , so , you know , i did see a report in the emergency room that your blood pressure was high there as well .
P: mm-hmm .
D: so , we'll have to just kind of talk about that . uh , but let's go ahead and we'll examine you .
P: sure .
D: okay ?
P: mm-hmm .
D: okay . so , you know , looking at you , your neck is very supple . i do n't appreciate any fibular venous distention . your heart is a regular rate and rhythm , no murmur . your lungs have some fine crackles in them , bilaterally . and you have trace lower extremity edema in both legs . so , what that means , essentially , is that you may have some extra fluid on board , um , from eating salty foods-
P: mm-hmm .
D: . along with this history of your congestive heart failure . but , let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the ecg . so , this is , uh , a s- a stable ecg for you . this basically shows that you have some left ventricular hypertrophy which caused your congestive heart failure . um , let's go ahead and review your echocardiogram . hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , in reviewing the results of your echocardiogram , it shows that your pumping function of your heart is a little low , uh , but it's stable . and , you know , i think that we know this and we have you on the appropriate-
P: mm-hmm .
D: medication therapy . and then , i just wan na be reminded about , um , the results of your skin biopsy . hey , dragon , show me the skin biopsy results . okay . and in reviewing the pathology report for your skin cancer-
P: mm-hmm .
D: . you know , it looks like they got all of that and everything's fine .
P: yep .
D: so , you know , my impression of you at this time , for the shortness of breath that you had in the emergency department , i think it was an exacerbation of your heart failure . and you probably had some , what we call , dietary indiscretion , you ate some salty food which made you retain some fluid .
P: mm-hmm .
D: so , for that , i'm going to prescribe you , you know , an extra dose of lasix 80 milligrams , once a day . and , um , we're going to , uh , put you on some carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . okay ?
P: okay . perfect .
D: um , and i think from a , a cataract surgery standpoint and your skin cancer removal , everything seems to be fine and you're doing well , so i do n't think we need to adjust any of those medications .
P: good to hear .
D: okay ? hey , dragon , order lasix 80 milligrams , once a day . hey , dragon , order carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . okay . and the nurse will come in and she'll see you soon . okay ?

D: okay , great . and then , um the chronic back pain , we've been giving you the gabapentin neurontin for that . is that helping control the pain ?
P: i think it is .
D: yeah .
P: it is ... it's definitely , um , i feel better .
D: uh- .
P: but it does come every now and then .
D: right . what do you do when it's really bad ?
P: um , i try to just get as much rest as i can .
D: okay . and you had talked about doing yoga . are you doing yoga anymore ?

P: mm-hmm .
D: so we're gon na put you on a medicine called combivent . okay , you're gon na do two puffs twice a day . it's gon na help open up your lungs . it's an inhaler .

P: it's my right upper arm . it hurts really , really bad .
D: so severe right upper arm pain .
P: yeah , uh yes .
D: and how did this happen ?
P: i was playing volleyball yesterday , uh last night . um and i went to spike the ball , and the team we were playing , they're dirty . so um , somebody right across from me kinda kicked my legs from under me as i was going up , and i fell and landed on my arm .
D: mm-hmm , like right on your shoulder .
P: yeah .
D: ow .
P: yes .
D: that sounds like it hurt .
P: it was nasty .
D: um , so this happened , what ? like 12 hours ago now ?

D: okay .
P: eighteen hours .
D: so less than a day .
P: yeah .
D: in severe pain .
P: yes .
D: have you taken anything for the pain ?
P: i've been taking ibuprofen every six hours i think , but it's really not helping at all .
D: okay , what would you rate your pain ?

P: yeah .
D: so like really severe ?

D: all right . let's uh , let's look at your x-ray .
D: hey dragon . show me the last radiograph . so this is looking at your right arm , and what i see is a proximal humerus fracture . so you kinda think of your humerus as a snow cone , and you knocked the-
P: the top of the snow cone ?

P: okay .

D: all right . so it's your right elbow ?
P: it's my right elbow , yes .
D: okay . hey dragon , ms. hernandez is a 48-year-old female here for a right elbow . so , tell me what happened .
P: well , i was , um , moving to a new home-
D: okay .
P: and i was , um , moving boxes from the truck into the house and i lifted a box up and then i felt like this popping-
D: hmm .
P: and this strain as i was lifting it up onto the shelf .
D: okay . and when- when did this happen ?
P: this was just yesterday .
D: all right . and have you tried anything for it ? i mean ...
P: i put ice on it . and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it still hurts at lot .
D: okay , what makes it better or worse ?
P: the ice , when i have it on , is better .
D: okay .
P: but , um , as soon as , you know , i take it off then it starts throbbing and hurting again .
D: all right . uh , let's review your past medical history . uh ... looks like you've got a history of anaphylaxis , is that correct ?
P: yes . yes , i do . yeah .
D: do you take any medications for it ?
P: um , ep- ... just an epipen .
D: just epipen for anaphylaxis when you need it . um , and what surgeries have you had before ?
P: yeah , so carotid . yeah-
D: . yeah , no , uh , your , uh , neck surgery .
all right . well let's , uh , examine you here for a second .
so it's your , uh , this elbow right here ?
P: yeah .
D: and is it hurt- ... tender right around that area ?
P: yes , it is .
D: okay . can you flex it or can you bend it ?
P: it hurts when i do that , yeah .
D: all right . and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can .
P: that's about it .
D: all right .
P: yeah .
D: so there's some swelling there . and how about , uh , can you move your fingers okay ? does that hurt ?
P: no , that's fine .
D: how about right over here ?
P: uh , no that's fine . yeah .
D: okay . so on exam you've got some tenderness over your lateral epicondyle . uh , you have some swelling there and some redness . uh , you have some pain with flexion , extension of your elbow as well . uh , and you have some pain on the dorsal aspect of your- of your forearm as well . okay ? so let's look at your x-rays . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . your x-ray of your elbow-
it looks like , i mean , the bones are lined up properly . there's no fracture-
D: . it , uh , there's a little bit of swelling there on the lateral elbow but i do n't see any fracture , so that's good . so , looking at the x-ray and looking at your exam , uh , my diagnosis here would be lateral epicondylitis , and this is basically inflammation of this area where this tendon in- inserts . and probably that happened when you were moving those boxes . so we'll try some motrin , uh , about 800 milligrams every six hours . uh , i'll give you a sling for comfort , just so you can use it if- if it's causing a lot of pain .
P: hmm .
D: and it should get better , uh , in about , you know , in a couple of days it should be improved . and if it does n't get better , give us a call and we'll see you some time next week . okay ? so we'll give you a sling , we'll give you the motrin , i'll give you about , uh , 30 , uh , uh , 30 , uh , uh , medications for that . uh , do you have any questions ?

D: hi , vincent . how are you ?
P: i'm good . how about you ?
D: i'm good . so le- are you ready to get started ?
P: i am .
D: okay . vincent is a 56-year-old male here with abnormal lab findings . so , i've heard you were in the er , vincent , and they found that you had a low hemoglobin .
P: yup .
D: were you having some dizziness and some lightheadedness ?
P: i was very lightheaded . i- i do n't know . very lightheaded .
D: okay . and have you noticed bleeding from anywhere ?
P: i have not . i have n't hurt myself in quite a while . maybe a slight nick from a knife while chopping some onions , but nothing more than that .
D: but no blood in your stools or-
P: no .
D: . anything like that ?
P: no .
D: okay . and any type of weight loss or decreased appetite or night sweats ? coughs ?
P: uh , s- slightly decreased appetite , but i wish i had some weight loss .
D: um , okay . and how about any abdominal pain ? fever , chills ?
P: uh , none of that .
D: okay . all right . um , any nausea or vomiting ?
P: not really . yeah . maybe a bit of nausea .
D: okay .
P: i- sitting at the back of a car , that makes me nauseous at times .
D: okay . all right . um , well , how are you doing in terms of your knee replacement . i know you had that done last year . that's going okay ?
P: mm , it seems okay . yeah .
D: okay . you're walking around without a problem ?
P: yup , yup . just not good enough to run yet , but everything else works just fine .
D: all right .
um , and i know a few years ago , you had , had that scare with the possible lung cancer , but then they did the biopsy and , and you've been fine .
P: yup , yup . all good .
D: turned out to be benign .
P: yup .
D: okay . great . all right . well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so looking at you , you do n't appear in any distress . your heart is regular . your lungs sound nice and clear . you have some tenderness to the right lower quadrant to palpation of your abdomen . your lower extremities have no edema .
D: um , all right . well , let's go ahead and look at your labs , okay ?
P: yup .
D: hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . yeah , so your hemoglobin is 8.2 , which is quite low for somebody of your height and weight , so we'll have to look into that a , a little bit further . i know that they did the endoscopy in the emergency room . hey , dragon , show me the endoscope results .
D: good . so it looks like you had some gastritis , which is just inflammation of your stomach and they also found a slight polyp , which i know that they biopsied and the results are pending at this time . um , so , you may have had some bleeding from the gastritis . it's not usual for people to have bleeding from that .
D: um , okay , well , hey , dragon , show me the anemia panel . okay .
D: anyway , okay . well , vincent , i think , you know , in terms of , my impression of you is that you've had this newfound anemia and for that , i think that we should go ahead and put you on protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day to help with the gastritis . does that sound okay to you ?
P: it does . you're the doctor . i do n't know what it is .
D: so that's just , uh , what we call a proton pump inhibitor which , uh , helps decrease the amount of acid secreted within your stomach .
P: got it . makes sense .
D: hey , hey , dragon , order protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day .
D: and i'd like you to try to cut down on your caffeine 'cause that can also irritate your stomach . try not to take any ibuprofen and try to cut down on any alcohol intake , okay ?
P: yup , yup . the coffee's the hard part .
D: yeah . it always is . how about one , one , one eight-ounce cup a day ? okay ?
P: sure .
D: um , and we'll go ahead and we'll see you in a couple weeks , okay ?
P: sure thing .
D: i'm going through , uh , i'll also order another , uh , cbc on you . hey , dragon , order a complete blood count .
D: all right . the nurse will be in soon . it's , you know , settle all that . i'll see you soon .
P: see you .

DIALOGUE:
D: next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
D: hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
P: i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
D: i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
P: yes , i did .
D: anything new since your last visit ?
P: no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
D: okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
P: i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
D: okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
P: okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
D: yep , right here .
P: wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
D: yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
P: that would be great .
D: so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
P: okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
D: maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
P: okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
D: maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
P: okay .
D: i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
P: you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
D: have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
P: i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
D: okay .
P: so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
D: okay , good .
P: and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
D: um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
P: i'm not sure what it is , either .
D: okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
P: okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
D: so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
P: okay .
D: chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
P: it wo n't , okay , thank you .
D: it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
P: okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
D: yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
P: okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
D: yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
P: okay , thank you . got it .
D: all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
P: no , not that i know of .
D: okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
P: yes .
D: all right .
P: um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
D: and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
P: no , i've never tried anything for it .
D: okay . we might give you some of that .
P: okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
D: okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
P: yes , i also do have that problem .
D: all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
P: okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
D: great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
P: okay .
D: all right , deep breath . all right , again .
P: okay .
D: all right , sounds good .
P: great .
D: let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
P: okay .
D: all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
P: okay , i will do that .
D: now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
P: okay , that's okay .
D: all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
P: yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
D: okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
P: okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
D: okay , great . let's see them .
P: okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
D: yeah , your alt was about 128 .
P: okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
D: yeah , this is much better .
P: okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
D: okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
P: okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
D: um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
P: okay .
D: this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
P: okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
D: yeah , that sounds like a plan .
P: okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
D: so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
P: okay , and what's involved with that ?
D: so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
P: okay .
D: so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
P: okay .
D: does that make sense ?
P: yes , it does .
D: so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
P: okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
D: um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
P: i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
D: if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
P: okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
D: correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
P: okay .
D: but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
P: and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
D: of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
P: i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
D: all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
P: okay , will do .
D: perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
P: i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
D: you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
P: okay , i can do that .
D: but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
P: okay , sounds good .
D: um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
P: okay .
D: and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
P: yes , that sounds great .
D: i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
P: okay , that would be great .
D: since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
P: okay .
D: and you just apply it before intercourse .
P: okay .
D: if you need some , uh , just let me know .
P: okay , i will . i'll let you know .
D: okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
P: okay , great , thank you so much .
D: you're welcome .
D: so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
D: i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
D: all right . let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
D: all right , sounds good .
D: let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
D: all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
D: now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
D: all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
D: okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
P: okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
D: yeah , your alt was about 128 .
D: okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time ."
D2N022,"EXAMPLE A/P DIALOGUE: 
D: martha is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure , depression and hypertension who presents for her annual exam . so , martha , it's been a year since i've seen you . how are you doing ?
D: let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your RESULTS, okay ? hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the result of the echocardiogram that we did last year .
D: um , hey , dragon , SHOW me the lipid panel . so , looking at your lipid panel from last year , you know , everything , your cholesterol was like , a tiny bit high . but it was n't too , too bad , so i know you're trying to watch your diet . so , we'll repeat another one this year , okay ?
D: um , so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ? so , for your first problem your congestive heart failure , um , i wan na continue you on your current medications . but i do wan na increase your lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day.
P: okay .
D: i also wan na repeat another echocardiogram , okay ?
P: all right .
D: hey , dragon , order an echocardiogram . from a depression standpoint , it sounds like you're doing really well with that . so , i'm , i'm really happy for you . i'm , i'm glad to see that you're in therapy and you're doing really well . i do n't feel the need to start you on any medications this year , unless you feel differently .
P: no , i feel the same way .
D: okay , all right . and then for your last problem your hypertension , you know , again i , i , i think it's out of control . but we'll see , i think , you know , i'd like to see you take the lisinopril as directed , okay ?

P: okay .
D: okay . do you have any questions ?
P: can i take all my pills at the same time ?
D: yeah .
P: 'cause i've been trying to take them at different times of the day , 'cause i did n't know if it was bad to take them all at once or i should separate them . i do n't know .
D: yeah . you can certainly take them , you know , all at the same time , as long , as yeah , they're all one scale . you can take them all at the same time . just set an alarm-
P: okay .
D: . some time during the day to take them , okay ?
P: that might help me remember better .

DIALOGUE:
D: this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , "" fds tendon , "" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .
D: at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .
D: his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?
P: i'm good , how about you ?
D: well , how can i help you today ?
P: so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .
D: so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?
P: um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .
D: okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?
P: yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .
D: mm-hmm .
P: and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .
D: yeah , i see that .
P: so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .
D: what do you do for a living ?
P: uh , i'm an x-ray tech .
D: well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?
P: nope .
D: uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?
P: uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .
D: okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?
P: uh , that's correct .
D: all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .
D: his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?
P: yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .
D: all right , how about here ?
P: um , there , it's not .
D: okay , not as bad ?
P: yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .
D: gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .
P: my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .
D: okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?
P: ow , .
D: okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .
P: well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .
D: well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .
P: okay . i thought it would straighten it out .
D: no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .
P: okay .
D: uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .
P: so the good one is good ?
D: yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .
P: okay , good .
D: yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .
P: okay , all right .
D: so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .
P: i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .
D: did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .
P: all right , we'll give it a try .
D: good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .
P: perfect .
D: all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .
P: the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .
D: hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .
P: will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...
D: yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .
P: okay , good .
D: so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?
P: uh , not at the moment .
D: all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .
P: um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?
D: yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .
P: all right , sounds like a plan .
D: all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .
P: thanks , doc .
D: right trigger finger injection template . attempted to inject one cc of celestone with f- , a half a cc of lidocaine . however , the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle , with contortions of the hand , and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with one cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . a small parma- , uh , palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger . recommended icing in it this evening , and taking ibuprofen .

DIALOGUE:
D: next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .
D: hey , how are you today ?
P: all right , how have you been ?
D: i'm good .
P: good , good .
D: have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
P: no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
D: really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
P: yeah , i guess that's it .
D: so health wise , how is everything going ?
P: good , the testosterone's going well .
D: that's great .
P: uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
D: okay , well that's good .
P: so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
D: yeah , i remember you telling me that .
P: and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
D: okay .
P: but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
D: good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
P: okay .
D: please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
P: okay .
D: in and out .
P: okay .
D: all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
P: great . so i wanted to show you something .
D: sure .
P: look at this .
D: okay , this is your cholesterol ?
P: yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
D: right .
P: now 5 months later look at my numbers .
D: wow , that's remarkable .
P: is it the test ? it's the only change .
D: i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
P: yeah .
D: but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
P: i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
D: yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
P: 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
D: absolutely .
P: my red blood cell count has increased .
D: yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
P: stable .
D: your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
P: yeah . , is it ?
D: yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
P: nice , that's good news .
D: so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
P: so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
D: yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
P: okay .
D: i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
P: okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
D: well , your levels are high .
P: are they right now ?
D: well , i mean they were last time .
P: yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
D: i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
P: i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
D: okay .
P: so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
D: all right .
P: i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
D: that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
P: okay .
D: you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
P: yeah , i'm feeling good .
D: i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
P: yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
D: likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
P: and they are taking stuff for a long time .
D: true . but right now i would not change your dose .
P: okay .
D: make sense ?
P: it does , i appreciate the discussion .
D: no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
P: no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
D: okay .
P: i would prefer the paper prescription .
D: for all of them ?
P: sure .

P: okay , thank you .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .
P: good , the testosterone's going well . uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
D: well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
P: okay .
D: please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
P: okay .
D: in and out .
P: okay .
D: all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
P: look at this .
D: okay , this is your cholesterol ?
P: yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
D: right .
P: now 5 months later look at my numbers .
D: wow , that's remarkable .
P: 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
D: absolutely .
P: my red blood cell count has increased .
D: yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
D: your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
P: yeah . , is it ?
D: yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
D: i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
P: okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
D: well , your levels are high .
D: i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
P: i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
D: okay .
D: all right .
D: that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
D: you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
D: i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
P: okay .
D: make sense ?
P: it does , i appreciate the discussion .
D: no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
P: no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
D: okay .
P: i would prefer the paper prescription .
D: for all of them ?
P: sure .
D: all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions ."

D: everything looks good .
P: yeah .
D: how's your back pain ?
P: i'm not really having any more .
D: any hard spots , lumps , or bumps that you've noticed ?
P: i did when i came in last time when i saw your pa , ruth sanchez in march . she said i , she said she found a lump right here under my left breast , but i have n't felt it since then . but i did the massages .
D: okay , well . that that's good . uh , it's probably just the scar tissue , but everything looks good and you're healing wonderful , so .
P: i told her that the scars here was kind of bothering me and i got scar gel . i was using it everyday , but i do n't think i need it now .
D: yeah , that scar did widen a little bit . let me take a closer look , hang on . this one widened a little too , ? the incisions are well healed though with no signs of infection or any redness on either breast , so i'm not concerned .
P: yeah , but this one just bothered me a little bit more .
D: i understand . um , you can close your gown now .
D: the only thing that is really going to help out that is to uh , to cut it out and re-close it .
P:
D: and you do n't want that , ?
P: i mean , not right now .
D: um , you want to come back and revisit um , maybe six months ?
P: yeah , i will do that . i still have n't , i still have some more of the gel and i can try using that again .
D: okay . keep doing that twice a day . the gel is going to lighten the color a little bit , which is already pretty light . um , but , just in that area , and it's high tension , so it's going to rub a little bit .
P: yeah , but it kind of bothers me a little bit .
D: uh , i do see that . like i said , the only way to really fix that is to cut it out .
P: uh- .
D: um , let's take a look in six months and then we'll go from there . sound like a plan ?
P: but we have n't hit a full year yet .
D: i know . um , i would n't do any revisions anyway for scar tissue until we're at least a year out anyway .
P: okay .
D: so let's wait those six months . you can keep using uh , the mederma scar gel twice a day . massage and scar gel will help for the scars . um , you can put it on other scars too , if you need .

DIALOGUE:
D: next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
D: hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
P: i'm doing okay , thank you .
D: i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
P: yeah , that would not be good .
D: i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
P: yeah , that's right .
D: okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
P: yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
D: well that's great .
P: yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
D: you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
P: yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
D: well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
P: haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
D: okay good .
P: um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
D: sure just , just keep it in moderation .
P: okay .
D: and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
P: uh yes , everything is good .
D: good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
P: no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
D: okay .
P: um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
D: great .
P: um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
D: okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
P: uh yeah , that's right .
D: all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
P: good , that's a relief to hear .
D: your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
P: okay .
D: all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
P: what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
D: um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
P: all righty .
D: so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
P: all righty that sounds good .
D: i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
P: okay great . that all sounds awesome .
D: all right let's take a quick listen .
D: use my general physical exam template .
D: and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
D: your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
P: all righty .
D: so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
P: yeah , that'll be okay .
D: great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
P: yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
D: perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
P: okay , i'll put that down .
D: you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
P: yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
D: lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
P: yeah , i have both .
D: okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
P: okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
D: um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
P: okay , good .
D: so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
P: okay , that sounds good .
D: i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
P: okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
D: so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
P: great , thank you .
D: you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
P: sounds good .
D: all right , assessment and plan .
D: chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
D: uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
D: uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .

DIALOGUE:
D: dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
P: good morning .
D: it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
P: it's nice to meet you as well .
D: so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
P: that's correct .
D: okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
P: well , right now the hand is .
D: mm-hmm .
P: and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
D: uh- .
P: and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
D: okay , that's good .
P: so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
D: okay , i see .
P: and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
D: mm-hmm , okay .
P: um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
D: okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
P: um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
D: probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
P: uh , no .
D: okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
P: no .
D: and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
P: um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
D: okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
P: well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
D: okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
P: uh , yes .
D: okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
P: yeah .
D: okay .
P: uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
D: really ?
P: yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
D: gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
P: uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
D: okay . is it neuropathy ?
P: uh , yep .
D: gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
P: okay .
D: all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
P: no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
D: okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
P: yeah , just a little strain .
D: okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
P: okay .
D: and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
P: uh , yes .
D: okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
P: i see .
D: so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
P: i think that sounds good to me .
D: okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
P: uh , no , i do n't .
D: okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
P: um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
D: okay .
P: i am taking eliquis , though .
D: okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
P: sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
D: okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
P: yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
D: okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
P: well , my hand is still bothering me .
D: okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
P: okay . sounds good .
D: all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
P: all right . is the mri today ?
D: um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .
P: all right .
D: all right . well , it was nice meeting you , my friend .
P: you as well . thank you .
D: physical exam , elderly white gentleman presents in a wheelchair . no apparent distress . per the template , down through neuro- neurologic . one plus bilateral biceps . triceps brachioradialis . reflexes bilateral all negative . follow up and take out the lower extremities . gait not assessed today . strength and sensation is per the template . uh , upper and lower extremities . musculoskeletal , he is non-tender over his cervical spine . he does have mildly restricted cervical exte- extension . right and left lateral rotation which is symmetric , which gives him mild lateral neck pain but no radi- radicular pain . spurling's maneuver is benign .
D: paragraph , diagnostics . cervical x-ray 6421 . cervical x-ray reveals significant disc degeneration at c56 , and to a lower extent c45 and c34 . significant lower lumbar facet arthropathy c67 and c7-t1 is difficult to visualize in the current x-rays .
D: paragraph , impression . number one , left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radicularopathy . possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy . number two , neck pain in the setting of arthritis disc degeneration .
D: paragraph , plan . i suspect that this is a flare of cervical radicularopathy . i'm going to set him up for a cervical mri , and we'll tentatively plan for a left c7-t1 epidural afterwards , although the exact location will be pending the mri results . he'll continue his home exercise program as well as twice a day gabapentin . we'll follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief . he denies any blood thinners .

D: um , hey , dragon , SHOW me the lipid panel . so , looking at your lipid panel from last year , you know , everything , your cholesterol was like , a tiny bit high . but it was n't too , too bad , so i know you're trying to watch your diet . so , we'll repeat another one this year , okay ?
D: um , so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ? so , for your first problem your congestive heart failure , um , i wan na continue you on your current medications . but i do wan na increase your lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day.

DIALOGUE:
D: eugene walker , n- date of birth 4/14/1960 . he's a 61-year-old male who presents today , uh , for a routine follow-up with chronic medical conditions .
D: of note , the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 1/22/2013 . regarding his blood work from 4/10/2021 , the patient's alkaline phosphatate- phosphatase , excuse me , was elevated to 156 . his lipid panel showed elevated total cholesterol of 247 , hdl of 66 , ldl of 166 , and triglycerides at 74 . the patient's tsh was normal at 2.68 . his cbc was unremarkable . his most recent vitamin d level was at the high end of normal at 94 .
D: good morning , mr. walker . how are you doing ? i mean , it's been a crazy year .
P: i'm doing fine , for the most part , but there are a few things i want to cover today .
D: sure . go right ahead .
P: uh , well , i'm having more fatigue , but i do n't know if it's age or if it's just , you know , drained at the end of the day . but i still ride my bike . i ca n't go as fast as i used to . i'm still riding , and , you know , after a long bike ride , i'll sit down and then boom . i'm out , you know ?
D: yeah . what's a long bike ride to you ?
P: uh , 20 to 30 miles .
D: 20 to 30 miles on a road bike ?
P: yeah , road bike . i think it's a time thing . if i had more time , i would try to do my 40 miles , but i have n't done that . obviously , we're too early in the season so my typical ride is , like , 20 , 30 . in years back , i could do 40 on a good day . i can still do 20 but , you know , i'm tired and have to take a break when i get home .
D: yeah , i understand .
P: and tyler's my buddy . he's always nice and waits for me , but i used to be able to beat him . but now , he waits for me all the time . he's older than me and it- it kills me .
D: yeah , i can imagine that would upset me too .
P: well , the last time , you know , you found a heart thing , then . just making sure that the valve is holding out , you know ?
D: right . so , when was your last stress test ?
P: it was september 9th , 2019 , because i'm eight years out from surgery , and back then , they said , you know , it's going to last eight years . and i'm at that year , so i just want to make sure . i asked dr. lewis for an echocardiogram to see how i'm doing .
D: yeah .
P: but it's not ... like , nothing has changed drastically since i saw you .
D: okay , good . do you still go down to hopkins at all ?
P: no , not at all . i just get follow-ups intermittently , here . going there is just ... it's too much stress .
D: okay .
P: one more thing , i want to make sure i do n't forget . my wife and friends tell me that when i walk , i purse my lips when i'm breathing . other doctors have said , "" did you notice your pursed lips breathing ? "" i do n't know if that's a bad habit or what .
D: okay . is there any wheezing associated with that ?
P: no , no wheezing .
D: and you're able to bike 30 miles and mostly keep up with your friend , tyler , correct ?
P: yeah . the only other thing i want to mention is it's not like i do routine testicular exams , but i know i have this little nodule on my right testicle .
D: on the testicle or the epididymis ?
P: epididymis . uh , i really do n't know . i'm not super concerned . i read a little online . just wanted to ask you .
D: and did you have a vasectomy ?
P: no . let me pull my notes out and make sure i mentioned everything i wanted to tell you . those were the only things and it's not like my tiredness is depression or anything . i'm a pretty happy guy overall , you know ? i just know you would ask those questions .
D: what time are you going to sleep , and about how many hours do you sleep a night ?
P: um , it varies . usually , i get six to seven hours of sleep . i get out of bed some days to be at work by 7:00 , lecture , and i try to work out in the morning . i- i do n't ... i'm not ... i'm not always successful , and now what i do is i- i do make reservations twice a week for a 5:45 swim in the morning .
D: okay , so you're getting six to seven hours of sleep , and has your wife ever mentioned if you snore or stop breathing at any time ?
P: i believe i snore a little bit , but she's never said anything about me not breathing .
D: okay . so , you're currently taking vitamin d3 , around 5000 units on sundays , and two thous ... or 50,000 units on sundays , excuse me , and 2000s on the other six days , and then clindamycin prior to dental procedures , correct ?
P: yeah , that's right .
D: have you had a covid-19 shot yet ?
P: i've received both . my first dose on january 15th , '21 and my second on february 5th , '21 .
D: good . if you'd hop up here on the table , we're just going to do a physical exam .
D: well , mr. walker , overall you're doing well . i'm going to order an echocardiogram and a stress test . i also recommend that you follow up with cardiology , i think dr. vincent sanchez would be a great fit for you .
P: all right .
D: also your recent labs showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level at 156 . now this could be related to your liver but most likely related to your bone health . we're going to check a few labs today .
P: you're going to have them done today ?
D: yes , sir , and we will send the results through your patient portal unless something is way off then we'll give you a call .
P: sounds good .
D: now as far as your breathing , i observed the pursed lip breathing and your exhalation is low . i think you should do a pulmonary function test to further evaluate , and i'll order that as well .
D: now the nodule in your right testicle should be evaluated by urology , and we will place that referral today , also .
P: sounds like i'm going to be busy getting this all checked out .
D: yes , sir . now you are due for your mmr and i'm recommend you get the shingles vaccine as well . you have completed your covid-19 , so that's good .
D: now i'm going to have , uh ... have you return in about a year for your wellness visit . we'll see you back sooner if needed after i review all those labs and those other studies .
D: do you have any other questions for me ?
P: no , doc . i think you covered it all .
D: great . okay , the nurse will , uh , be back in a minute to give you mmr today , and the front desk will line up a time to do the shingles vaccine next month .
P: thanks , doc . have a great day .
D: all right , i used my general physical exam template for respiratory notate : pursed lip breathing , low exhalation phase , clear to oscillation , no wheezing . uh , genitalia notate : right testicle with two to three millimeters palpable nodule does not feel as if it will ... does not feel as if with the epididymis or variococele ; left testicle , normal ; no hernia . all other portions of the physical exam are normal default .
D: assessment history of the aortic aneurysm repair : the patient underwent and aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 1/20/2013 . he is doing well overall and currently asymptomatic . he is currently not seen by cardiology routinely . suggest the following up and suggested vincent sanchez as his physician . we will perform an echocardiogram , eh , slash , stress test .
D: elevated alkaline phosphatase level . most recent cmd showed elevation at 156 . this could be related to his liver but most likely re- related to his bone health . i've ordered an alkaline phosphatase and again a gt .
D: lung field abnormal finding on exona ... excuse me , on examination . the patient has been noted to purse his lips while breathing . he was found himself ... he has found himself feeling more fatigued at the end of the day . he does bicycle around 20 to 30 miles at a time . his exhal- exhalation phase is low on exam , and i've ordered pfts today to further ... for further evaluation .
D: the right testicular nodule is about two to three millimeters , i've noted on the exam . there's no hernia palpable , and i have suggested reaching out to ro ... urology for a possible ultrasound .
D: preventative health : the most recent blood work was reviewed with no significant abnormalaries ... abnormalities other than the cmv . uh , we will perform mmr titer today . i have suggested the shingles vaccine and he is fully vaccinated against covid-19 .
D: patient will return , uh , for a follow-up in one year for a wellness visit , sooner if needed . he is to call with any questions or concerns .

DIALOGUE:
D: patrick allen . date of birth : 7/7/1977 . new patient visit . past medical history includes gerd , anxiety , depression . here for chronic abdominal pain . he had an abdominal ct on 1/23/2020 . impression is a normal ct of the ab- abdomen .
D: hello , are you mr. allen ?
P: yes , i am .
D: hi . my name is dr. edwards . nice to meet you .
P: nice to meet you .
D: welcome to the gi specialty clinic .
P: thank you .
D: did you have any problems finding us ?
P: no , i've been here with my sister once before .
D: good . so how can i help you today ? uh , the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea .
P: right . so i've had ... i've been having this pain right here in my stomach , like right around here .
D: so in the area of your mid abdomen , just below the belly button ?
P: correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .
D: i saw that .
P: yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .
D: yes , i agree . it looked normal .
P: the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .
D: is the pain there all the time ?
P: it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .
D: has this been the case over the past two years as well ?
P: more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea .
D: and before that , how are your bowel movements ?
P: they were normal .
D: uh , okay . so any blood in your stool ?
P: nope .
D: do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ?
P: probably more constipation .
D: okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ?
P: i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard .
D: and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ?
P: about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .
D: okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ?
P: yeah , it gets a little better .
D: and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ?
P: none of that .
D: okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ?
P: it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea .
D: okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ?
P: it's usually just one time and then it's over .
D: and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ?
P: nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .
D: okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ?
P: not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .
D: okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ?
P: nope .
D: have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ?
P: i've never had any surgery .
D: okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ?
P: yup .
D: and have you ever had a colonoscopy ?
P: no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .
D: well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits .
P: okay .
D: well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you .
P: okay .
D: i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants .
P: what does that mean ? is everything okay ?
D: it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working .
P: okay , good .
D: so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain .
P: it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .
D: okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?
P: yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .
D: okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?
P: he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .
D: and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?
P: he said the alt and the ast were elevated .
D: and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?
P: i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .
D: and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?
P: hardly ever . maybe once a month .
D: and do you consume alcohol ?
P: uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .
D: okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?
P: nope .
D: and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?
P: nope .
D: and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?
P: no .
D: okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .
P: what would cause that ?
D: issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .
P: okay .
D: lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .
P: that's good .
D: yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .
P: what's that ?
D: increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .
P: and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?
D: the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .
P: but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?
D: correct .
P: so what does that mean ?
D: well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .
P: okay .
D: so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .
P: could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?
D: no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .
P: so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?
D: well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .
P: so what do i need to do ?
D: well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .
P: okay . and then what ?
D: we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .
P: which medications ?
D: crestor , how long have you been taking that ?
P: about 18 months .
D: okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .
P: should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?
D: i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .
P: okay . i'll call him this afternoon .
D: great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .
P: okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?
D: hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .
P: okay . and then what happens ?
D: when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .
P: and when should i see you again ?
D: uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .
P: okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?
D: definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .
P: okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .
D: excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?
P: i do n't think so .
D: great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .
P: okay . sounds good .
D: and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .
P: all right . thanks , dr. edwards .
D: thank you , mr. allen .

DIALOGUE:
D: next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma .
D: mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .
P: likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .
D: yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?
P: yes , that's what the biopsy said .
D: okay and when did you first notice the spot ?
P: my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .
D: i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?
P: yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .
D: well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?
P: my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .
D: okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?
P: my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .
D: okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?
P: mother's .
D: okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?
P: no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .
D: good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?
P: yes , that's correct .
D: okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?
P: i own an auto repair shop .
D: okay and have you ever been a smoker ?
P: yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .
D: i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?
P: i had gall bladder and appendix .
D: okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?
P: no , i've been feelin' great .
D: good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .
P: sure .
D: okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?
P: okay , that's fine .
D: all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .
D: okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .
P: okay , i should n't worry too much then ?
D: no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .
P: okay , good .
D: so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .
P: okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .
D: yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .
P: yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .
D: good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .
P: yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .
D: good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?
P: um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .
D: okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .
P: thank you , nice to meet you as well .
D: please add the following pathology r- , to results . a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading . histology , superficial spreading . clark level 4 , breslow thickness 0.7 millimeters , radial growth phase present , vertical growth phase not identified . mitotic features , less than one millimeter squared . ulceration not identified , progression not identified , lymphatic invasion not identified , perineural invasion not identified , microscopic satellitosis not identified . infiltrating , uh , lymphocytes , breast . um , melanocytic nevus not identified . predominant cytology epithelioid , peripheral margin positive , deep margin , uh , negative , stage 1 . also note that i reviewed the dermatologist's photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central a melanotic component and irregular border .
D: for assessment and plan , the patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma . biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma . on examination today , there is right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency . i recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease . if the ultrasound is normal , the patient is a candidate for wide local excision with a one to two centimeter margin .
D: primary closure should be possible , but skin graft closure may be needed . the relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed . the need for follow-up , according to the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines , was reviewed . we also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance , skin self-examination , and the abcdes of mole surveillance .
D: after discussing the procedure , risk and expected outcomes , and possible complications , questions were answered and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed .

P: my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
D: mm . okay .
P: and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
D: i see .
P: i mean , i'm fine now .
D: well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
P: i did .
D: and that was before we started the progesterone .
P: yes .
D: so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
P: yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
D: hmm , okay .
P: and it seemed like it was for no reason .
D: but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
P: yes .
D: all right . so not really a link there , all right .
P: yeah , i do n't know .
D: yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
P: i figured maybe that's what it was .
D: and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
P: yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
D: yeah , i can absolutely see that .
P: yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
D: well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
P: no .
D: have you lost weight ?
P: no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
D: all right .
P: and now i am feeling better .
D: okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
P: well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
D: okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
P: no .
D: all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
P: not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
D: all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
P: yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
D: okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
P: okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
D: have you had the vaccine ?
P: yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
D: okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
P: yeah , i agree .
D: all right . well , let's complete your exam .
P: all right .
D: so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
P: yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
D: mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
P: it does , where your left hand just was .
D: okay , right here ?
P: yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
D: yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
P: yeah .
D: all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
P: yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
D: okay .
P: uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
D: okay , great . all right , looks good .
P: good .
D: you can go ahead and sit up .
P: thank you .
D: all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
P: okay . and what could that mean ?
D: well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
P: and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
D: well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
P: yeah .
D: so those are all good things .
P: okay .
D: because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
P: we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
D: yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
P: yeah , i agree there .
D: um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
P: okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
D: all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
P: okay , i think that sounds great .
D: all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
P: no , i think i'm all set .
D: all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
P: all right , thank you . you have a good day too .
D: all right .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
P: no , that's new .

DIALOGUE:
D: sophia brown . date of birth , 3/17/1946 . this is a new patient visit . she's here to establish care for a history of dcis . we'll go over the history with the patient .
D: hello , ms. brown .
P: hi . yes , that's me .
D: wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .
P: you as well .
D: so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?
P: yes . on january 20th , 2020 .
D: okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?
P: no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
D: perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
P: sounds good .
D: great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
P: it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
D: i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
P: yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
D: yep , definitely .
D: based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
P: yes . unfortunately .
D: i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
P: yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
D: and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
P: yes .
D: okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?
P: yes . fingers crossed .
D: definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .
P: okay , sounds good .
D: i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?
P: i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
D: okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
P: gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
D: okay . do you have children ?
P: i do . i have five .
D: ah , big family then . that's nice .
P: yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
D: i bet . sounds like fun .
P: it is .
D: did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
P: really , i did not .
D: okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
P: my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
D: okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
P: okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
D: okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
P: that's correct .
D: okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
P: yes , and that's all .
D: okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
P: i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
D: okay . and how about family history ?
P: my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
D: all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
P: none .
D: did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
P: i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
D: wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
P: no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
D: excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
P: nope , just penicillin .
D: okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
D: okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
D: in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
D: do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
P: i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
D: okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
P: okay , sounds good .
D: as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
D: so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
P: okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
D: in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
P: okay , i can do that .
D: wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?
P: i do n't think so .
D: okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !

DIALOGUE:
D: alright you can go ahead
P: hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so
D: how you doing is it is it gotten any better
P: yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started
D: so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit
P: hmmm
D: i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of
P: okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that
D: no nothing at all
P: okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that
D: no
P: okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before
D: i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help
P: okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck
D: i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain
P: alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder
D: it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere
P: okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go
D: it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well
P: okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it
D: yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all
P: i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently
D: alright
P: and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers
D: no numbness or tingling
P: okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater
D: okay
P: tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro
D: yeah
P: acromioclavicular joints
D: yeah yeah
P: and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch
D: yes thank you yep
P: so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are
D: most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder
P: and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before
D: i have n't
P: okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan
D: so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away
P: yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days
D: okay alright thank you
P: bye
D: okay bye

P: yes
D: okay so pain on the medial side with palpation
P: yes
D: alright how about the outside
P: no

D: yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
P: you do a stick needle in my elbow
D: mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow

P: that it activates the healing
D: yeah that's exactly what it is
P: interesting cool
D: yeah

P: i'm excited
D: yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that

P: is that golfer's elbow
D: yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
P: well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
D: okay also known as pictures elbow
P: well i have n't been pitching either
D: hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this
P: mm-hmm
D: that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
P: thank god
D: yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
P: no please tell me remind me
D: yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
P: you do a stick needle in my elbow
D: mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
P: so it's kinda like dry needling then
D: no
P: not at all
D: what is it
P: is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
D: mm-hmm
P: and then you literally inject it into my tendon
D: yes
P: that it activates the healing
D: yeah that's exactly what it is
P: interesting cool
D: yeah
P: maybe i have heard about that
D: we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
P: i'm excited
D: yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that"

DIALOGUE:
P: hey bruce so see here my my notes here is you here he had positive lab work for hep c so how're you doing today
D: i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive
P: okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c
D: no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised
P: okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners
D: i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now
P: okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay
D: thank you
P: so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot
D: i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to
P: okay and have you ever smoked before
D: i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too
P: yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well
D: okay
P: so do you have any other medical conditions
D: no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise
P: okay and what conditions would you say run in your family
D: i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression
P: okay
D: alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate
P: regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly
D: hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one
P: splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound
D: i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them
P: okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay

DIALOGUE:
D: hi virginia how are you today what brings you in
P: i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys
D: okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling
P: i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high
D: okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home
P: yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
D: okay
P: and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
D: wow
P: so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
D: yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
P: yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
D: okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
P: yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
D: okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
P: did they
D: yeah
P: that's good to know
D: you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
P: alright do you want the honest answer
D: well yeah that would be better
P: so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
D: okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
P: really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
D: okay what about chest pain
P: no chest pain
D: shortness of breath
P: no shortness of breath
D: even with exertion
P: even with exertion
D: okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
P: not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
D: okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
P: both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
D: okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
P: yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
D: okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
P: yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
D: okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
P: i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
D: okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
P: no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control

D: okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam your vitals look good and everything there looks okay now i'm gon na do a focused exam on your right ankle i do appreciate some ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus malleolus associated with some edema or swelling of that area you are positive for tenderness to palpation of the anterior lateral soft tissue and now i do n't appreciate any laxity on anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation to that foot or ankle area now on neurovascular exam of your right foot you have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch and all of that is consistent with what's present on your left side as well
D: so i did review the results of your of your x-ray the x-ray of your right ankle showed no fracture which is a good thing
D: so now let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem of right ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain or i'm sorry right ankle sprain of your lateral ligament complex more specifically your anterior talofibular ligament now this ligament's on the outside of your ankle ankle which got stretched when you fell the best treatment at this time for your sprain is to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and let's continue to ice okay you're gon na be given an air cast which is gon na help stabilize that ankle and i'm also going to prescribe some crutches because i want you to stay off that leg and start walking on it stay off your leg for now and then in a couple of days start walking on it as tolerated do you have any questions or concerns for me
P: so how long do you think it'll take to heal
D: so your symptoms should significantly improve over a few weeks but i'd like to follow up with you and see how you're doing let's say i'll see you again in fourteen days now i do want you to go ahead and continue to take nsaids or ibuprofen as needed to help with any pain and that's also gon na help reduce that inflammation and swelling okay
P: okay"

D: alright were you able to continue playing
P: no i had to stop i actually it was like i had to be held from the field because i could n't put weight on my foot
D: i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then
P: i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen
D: okay could you one more time when did this injury happen
P: this happened about couple days ago
D: okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all
P: yeah it helps a little bit but then you know it it you know after a while it wears out
D: okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling
P: no no numbness
D: okay alright any loss in sensation
P: no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot
D: okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out
P: i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep
D: i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah
P: that scares me
D: it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay
P: okay
D: alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt
P: no uh uh
D: okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions
P: yeah do i have to do the surgery
D: so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with
P: i just hate that word surgery doc
D: i know
P: you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too
D: so it's actually
P: have to be in the hospital
D: no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed
P: i'm right handed
D: yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what
P: i mean
D: uh uh
P: does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i

D: yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there

DIALOGUE:
D: hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on
P: and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago
D: okay
P: started having pain on my left back
D: okay
P: and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain
D: okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go
P: it's constant
D: okay
P: all the time i ca n't get comfortable
D: alright are you able to urinate
P: i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood
D: okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
P: i've had it for probably this might be my third time
D: third time alright
P: yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time
D: okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
P: no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
D: okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
P: yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
D: okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
P: yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
D: right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
P: yeah
D: so we are getting close there
P: okay
D: yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
P: i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
D: so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
P: like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
D: okay
P: and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
D: the one eighties which was really high
P: right
D: so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
P: trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
D: yeah
P: like
D: we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
P: yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
D: so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
P: i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
D: okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
P: i do
D: okay
P: i do take it
D: that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
P: no chest pain
D: no chest pain are you having any belly pain
P: the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
D: no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
P: yes
D: okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
P: yes
D: alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound

D: okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go
P: well when i you know after i found out i had a disk a kidney stone it came a couple times but it did n't last as long no i've been i've been straining my urine they told me to pee in this little cup
D: mm-hmm
P: and i've been straining my urine and you know i do n't see anything in there
D: okay have you noticed any blood in your urine i know you've been draining probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual
P: no not really not really darker
D: okay so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them but
P: i've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot but i've never had one
D: okay alright so let me do a quick exam of you your vital signs look good i do n't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine so let me do a quick physical exam let me press here on your belly so on your examination of your abdomen there is no tenderness to to pain to palpation of the abdomen there is no rebound or guarding there is cva there is tenderness on the right side so that means
P: i have a stroke
D: can you repeat that
P: i did i have a stroke
D: no no no no no so that means like everything is normal right but i feel like you you you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney so that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone so i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone hasses and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good
P: that sounds perfect dear too
D: alright
P: thank you document
D: so i will see you in a week or so and hopefully you've passed that stone and i'll send my nurse in with that prescription
P: okay thank you
D: thanks

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: so let me do a quick exam of you your vital signs look good i do n't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine so let me do a quick physical exam let me press here on your belly so on your examination of your abdomen there is no tenderness to to pain to palpation of the abdomen there is no rebound or guarding there is cva there is tenderness on the right side so that means
D: i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that
D: so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone hasses and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good"

P: but it still hurts even with ibuprofen
D: alright have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills
P: i have n't thrown up but i felt a little bit nauseated
D: little nauseated yeah that's we expected so have you do you have a family history of kidney stones i know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff but
P: yeah my my dad had kidney stones i think he has passed a couple of them i'm not quite sure
D: alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one
P: this is my first time i've never had this before
D: okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that
P: yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone
D: okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain
P: not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them
D: okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt
P: a little bit yeah
D: a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far
P: probably not enough i drink some but
D: okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me
P: no i do n't think so
D: alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright

D: okay so you say you've injured your right foot before tell me a little bit about that injury
P: twenty years ago i broke my ankle i had to put in a cast but that seems to be okay but you know sometimes it'll give me trouble once in a while it feels a little sore it swells up at times
D: okay
P: and my other ankle too is sore sometimes and i've had surgery for that too and you know one of those things where you know it might give out once in a while but i'm not sure that's related to what the you know break dropping on my foot but you know either way my foot's a little sore
D: okay alright so when you dropped that brick on your foot were you able to get up and keep working or did you have to get off your you know not stop weightbearing and and get off that foot can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident
P: i you know it was a little sore i called a few names you know god damn why is this in my foot but you know i kept working putting it around a little bit but now it's got swollen so i got to see my doctor he told me i had to go see you here i am so tell me what's going on with it
D: so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult
P: lucken it up
D: okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain
P: no i feel like taking the medicine
D: okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet
P: no not yet i heard about it though i might have to make a trip once my foot heals
D: alright that sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life
P: eleven out of ten
D: okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident
P: yeah the whole foot is numb
D: okay
P: but been now for a long time
D: okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that
P: what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast

D: okay okay and so so dad how often are you seeing the twitch on karen
P: i do n't know i mean it varies sometimes i see it several times an hour and there is other days we do n't see it at all until sometimes late afternoon but we definitely notice it you know everyday for the last several weeks
D: okay so karen how is how is how is soccer
P: i like soccer
D: yeah
P: yeah dad dad takes me to play every saturday
D: okay
P: it's it's pretty fun but there's this girl named isabella she she plays rough
D: does she
P: she yeah she tries to kick me and she pulls my hair and
D: oh
P: sometimes she's not very nice
D: that is n't very nice you gon na have to show her that that's not very nice you're gon na have to teach her a lesson
P: yeah and and then sometimes after soccer we we go and i get mcdugge's and it and it's it makes for a nice day with dad
D: is that your favorite at mcdonald's in the the mcnuggates
P: not not really but they are cheap so
D: okay alright well you you made dad happy at least right
P: yeah that's what he says because i'm expensive because i want dresses and dogs and stuff all the time
D: yeah well yeah who does n't well okay well hopefully we will get you you know squared away here so you can you know play your soccer and go shopping for dresses with dad so so dad tell me does the karen seem bothered or any other and have any other issues when this happens
P: no i mean when it happens she just continues playing or doing whatever she was doing when it happens
D: okay alright has she has she otherwise been feeling okay since this started has she been acting normally
P: i i'd say she seems fine i mean she has been eating well and playing with her friends and she goes about her normal activities really
D: okay good
P: never even though anything was going on
D: okay alright good so has has karen had any seizures in the past
P: no
D: no okay and then so tell me when the twitch occurs do you ever notice any you know parts of her like moving or twitching
P: well no uh it's just her face
D: okay
P: i mean the whole side of her face moves when it happens it seems like it several seconds and then it finally stops and she just seems to be blinking frequently and and and you know wait a minute i i did make a video so you can see just in case it does n't do it during the visit
D: okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome
P: well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing
D: yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger
P: really i had nobody in our family got anything like that
D: okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills
P: no
D: okay coughing headache
P: ma'am
D: okay how about any problems with karen's sleep
P: nope
D: okay okay good let's go ahead and do physical exam on karen here alright karen i'm just gon na take a look at you and and ask you to follow some commands okay
P: okay
D: alright can you follow my finger with your eyes good now can you do me a favor walk across the room for me great job okay now i want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now keep your eyes closed can you feel me touch you here how about okay how about there
P: mm-hmm
D: does that feel the same
P: yeah
D: okay alright so i'm just gon na check your reflexes okay alright now on your on the neurological exam the patient is awake alert and oriented times three speech is clear and fluent gait is steady heel toe walking is normal and the cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen
P: that's great
D: good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me
P: so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing
D: yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards
P: so you're not recommending any kind of treatment there is no pill or cream or nothing
D: not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall and the tic has n't impacted her school or her activities but if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay
P: alright alright sounds good

DIALOGUE:
P: alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on
D: you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever
P: wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms
D: you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot
P: okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or
D: urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room
P: wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for
D: you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week
P: mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm
D: you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay
P: alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay
D: no i do n't do that
P: okay
D: none of us do
P: okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either
D: no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick
P: alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him
D: you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load
P: mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings
D: yeah there is actually ten of us
P: wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings
D: yeah i'm okay
P: maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place
D: yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family
P: you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies
D: no no i have never had any problems with allergies
P: okay and do you smoke
D: i do n't smoke
P: do you live with anybody who does
D: i do not
P: okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay
D: okay
P: so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions
D: yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick
P: so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help
D: okay it does
P: alright
D: thank you
P: okay no problem
D: alright

DIALOGUE:

D: i'm doing well but my my big toe hurts and it's a little red too but it really hurts okay how long has this been going on i would say you know off and on for about two weeks but last week is is when it really became painful i was at a a trade show convention and i could n't walk the halls i could n't do anything i just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time i was there
P: okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it
D: it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending
P: okay sorry i got a text and
D: well that's okay you know what i i you know i what i really you know i love to ride bikes have you you ride bike at all
P: no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner
D: my gosh i love to ride i ride the lot of rails the trails i mean i go all the last year i put in over eight hundred miles on rails the trails
P: yeah those those are nice
D: yeah
P: does it does riding your bike bother your big toe
D: no because i i kinda pedal with the the back of my feet you know on that side
P: okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal
D: i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops
P: okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started
D: no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned
P: okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother
D: absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot
P: okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine
D: i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help
P: okay
D: alrighty
P: let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom
D: yeah ouch
P: big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt
D: it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down
P: okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt
D: yeah it a little when you take it a little further
P: if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt
D: that hurts more yeah
P: okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt
D: yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too
P: okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt
D: a little bit but not terrible
P: okay what about if i push on the other side here
D: yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely
P: okay
D: yep
P: okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray
D: okay
P: and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan
D: okay
P: so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back
D: you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in
P: okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint
D: oh
P: and you've lost a lot of the cartilage
D: oh
P: and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day
D: okay
P: it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach
D: no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach
P: i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there
D: yeah
P: below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call
D: okay
P: okay
D: okay
P: and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot
D: okay
P: or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes
D: is that surgery
P: i have to
D: would that be
P: i'm sorry
D: would that be surgery clean out the joint
P: yeah that would
D: okay
P: that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer
D: okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done
P: no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks

DIALOGUE:
D: okay
P: good morning
D: good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it
P: sure absolutely what can i help you with today
D: so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
P: but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
D: and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
P: okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
D: i have an albuterol inhaler
P: okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
D: so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
P: okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
D: i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
P: okay and then when you use your inhaler
D: mm-hmm
P: does it does it alleviate the problem
D: so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
P: yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
D: okay
P: so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
D: mm-hmm
P: for the symptoms
D: yes
P: and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
D: yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
P: okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
D: pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
P: okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
D: yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
P: alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
D: yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
P: okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
D: so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
P: okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
D: mm-hmm
P: and then we can talk a little bit more
D: okay
P: i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
D: mm-hmm
P: and everything sounds good
D: let me take a look at your eyes
P: mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
D: yeah i think so yeah
P: i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
D: mm-hmm
P: and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
D: okay
P: and throat looks fine no tonsils
D: mm-hmm
P: lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
D: okay
P: everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
D: mm-hmm
P: everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
D: awesome
P: it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
D: mm-hmm
P: and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
D: and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
P: in terms of the mood is this new for you
D: yeah i think so like when i started this year
P: and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
D: yeah
P: okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
D: mm-hmm
P: and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too
D: okay alright sounds like a plan okay
P: thank you

P: i landed on my side i was not able to continue on
D: okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question
P: not really
D: no
P: he does n't have much game
D: okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
P: on the inside
D: on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
P: i had ice and an ace wrap
D: you had ice and what
P: an ace wrap
D: and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
P: seven
D: seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
P: correct
D: and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
P: every morning
D: okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
P: no
D: okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
P: yes
D: yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
P: i did not no
D: you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
P: some exercises ice and mobic
D: okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
P: yes it hurts
D: okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
P: when can i play basketball again
D: yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
P: i just played the wife with fun
D: okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment
P: yeah they do
D: okay i you know i'm i'm just thinking you know i need to get some new shoes for some of it my activities i love the i wish i could play basketball but i do a lot of bike riding so i'm always looking for anything that's gon na help me on the bike do you does your family have supplies like that
P: we do let me know and i can get you the hook up
D: okay great great so i'll i i will let you know i'll just get on and take a look first but i'm gon na go ahead and get get you discharged i'll have my assistant come in we will get you discharged and like i said we will make an appointment for seven days and we will go from there any questions
P: i think you've answered them all thank you
D: okay great

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago
D: okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control
D: now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
P: no
D: okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
P: yes
D: yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
P: i did not no
D: you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
P: some exercises ice and mobic
D: okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion
D: you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me
D: you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee
D: there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground
D: i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee
D: that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that
D: i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling
D: then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician
D: well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament."

P: yeah it's it's been a challenge
D: alright and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that are you peeing a whole lot or anything like that no

D: okay alright no weakness or numbness in your legs right now
P: no
D: okay
P: no
D: so let me examine you now gloria i'm gon na go ahead and do an exam and let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings just so i can record this and put it into my my into my chart so neck exam you do have a little bit of swelling in your neck little bit of jvd no bruits your lung exam you have some crackles in both bases and some rales that i can hear and there are a little bit of intermittent wheezing as well on your heart exam you have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past otherwise regular rate and rhythm it does n't feel a regular your belly exam your belly's slightly distended there's no tenderness or guarding or anything like that so that does n't that looks pretty good on your leg exam you do have some one plus pitting edema or actually almost one and a half plus pitting edema in your both of your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign that means no blood clots otherwise neurologic exam is normal the rest of your exam is normal so what does this all mean so let me explain that so for the first problem the shortness of breath you know i think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure what i'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from twenty milligrams to sixty milligrams for the next four days i'm gon na have you check your weights everyday and also i'm gon na go ahead and have you use your albuterol and atrovent we had given you some inhalers in the past i can give you another refill if you need to help with that some of the breathing that you're having the shortness of breath so i'd like to get some of this fluid off you have you check your weights daily we'll have you increase your dose of lasix we'll have you use a breathing treatments and see if that helps your shortness of breath i'd like to have you come back in about couple days actually i wan na see how you're doing and if it does n't get better we may have to increase the dose or send you to the hospital okay
P: i do n't want to go to the hospital doctor
D: yeah so let's try to let's try to use the lasix and let's try to let's try to you know use the breathing treatments and and do that for the second problem the diabetes that we just talked about i like to go ahead and order another blood test another hemoglobin a1c i think we need to your blood sugars have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked your last one so i wan na check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days we should have the results back we can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of the you know add a different medication at that point but but right now i'm gon na order some blood tests we'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point okay
P: so i had a piece of cake before i came in here is that gon na affect the the lab work
D: yeah we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar we'll we'll order the hemoglobin a1c that should n't be actually matter because that checks long term but if we need your blood sugar may be elevated today i i would n't be surprised alright and i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain i'm gon na go ahead and put you on some naprosyn and some flexeril which is a muscle relaxer i'm gon na give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch it'll also help your blood sugar and why do n't we have you if that does n't work the the pain medicine and the physical we can start physical therapy and see if that helps okay

D: so for the first problem the shortness of breath you know i think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure what i'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from twenty milligrams to sixty milligrams for the next four days 
D: so for the second problem the diabetes that we just talked about i like to go ahead and order another blood test another hemoglobin a1c i think we need to your blood sugars have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked your last one so i wan na check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple of days we should have the results back we can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of the you know add a different medication at that point
D: i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain i'm gon na go ahead and put you on some naprosyn and some flexeril which is a muscle relaxer i'm gon na give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch it'll also help your blood sugar and why do n't we have you if that does n't work the the pain medicine and the physical we can start physical therapy and see if that helps"

D: okay well you know that's not good we'll we'll hopefully we can get you fixed up here so how much how much pain have you been in on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt
P: it's it's more like so when i first fell it was pretty bad but now it's it's at like a six you know like it's uncomfortable
D: okay and how would you describe that pain is it a constant pain or is it only when you move the ankle
P: it's it's constant it's like a throbbing pain you know and like when i touch it it feels kinda warm
D: okay alright yeah but yeah i can feel it here so it does feel a little bit warm so i said you've been in a little bit of pain so have you taken anything for it
P: well like last night i iced it and i kept it elevated you know i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning
D: alright has the ibuprofen helped at all
P: not really
D: okay alright so i just want to know i know some of my patients they have like bad ankles where they hurt the ankles all the time but have you ever injured this ankle before
P: so you know in high school i used to play a lot of soccer but and and like i had other injuries but i've never injured like this particular ankle before but because i used to play like all the time i knew what i was supposed to do but this is i also knew that it was it was time to come in
D: okay yeah yeah definitely if you if you ca n't walk on it we definitely good thing that you came in today and we were able to see you so have you experienced any numbness in your foot at all
P: no no numbness and i do n't think i've had like any tingling or anything like that
D: okay that that's good yeah it sounds like you have sensation there so yeah that that's really good so let me do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals your blood pressure was one twenty over eighty which is good your heart rate your spo2 was ninety eight percent which is good that means you're you're getting all of your oxygen and so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick so when i press here does that hurt
P: yeah
D: alright what about here
P: yeah
D: okay so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is ecchymosis so you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral
P: malleolus
D: malleolus associated with swelling there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue there is no laxity on the anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot there your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so we did get an x-ray of your ankle before you came in and luckily it's there is no fractures no bony abnormalities which is really good so let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your right ankle pain your symptoms your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain have you sprained your ankle before most times people do the athletics play soccer it happens every so often but have you done that before
P: no i do n't think so
D: okay well you're one of the lucky ones some of my my patients that play sports they sprain their ankle seems like every other week so good for you so for that that that ankle sprain i just want to keep i want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and i want you to continue to ice it you can ice it let's say five times a day for twenty minutes at a time just to help that swelling go down i'm gon na give you an air cast to help you stabilize the ankle so keep it from moving and then i'll give you crutches and so i want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days and then you can start walking on it as tolerated tolerated so how does that sound
P: it's alright
D: alright so do you have any questions for me
P: yeah like how long do you think it's gon na take for me to heal
