She will be provided with resources and support for quitting, such as nicotine replacement therapy, behavioral counseling, quitline and online programs.

She will have her lipid panel repeated in June. Preventive care: She received her coronavirus vaccine on February 9th. I recommend upgrading her influenza vaccination and shingrix. She deferred these today. She is up to date on her mammogram, pap smear, and colonoscopy. She will have her bone density scan in June. She will continue to take calcium and vitamin D supplements.
