Management of psoriatic arthritis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Judy Gomez is a 62-year-old female with a history of psoriatic arthritis, who presents today for ongoing management of her condition. The patient's current medication regimen consists of prednisone and methotrexate. She reports having decreased her prednisone dose to once daily and is experiencing improved symptoms. However, she notes additional pain in her feet on days of increased activity. This has resulted in her occasionally taking an extra dose of prednisone once a week. 

She reports that methotrexate has been helpful in managing her joint pain, although she did experience a severe flare of symptoms when she temporarily discontinued it during the week of her first COVID-19 vaccine dose. Upon consulting medical professionals, she continued the medication during her second dose without any problems. 

Ms. Gomez reports bruising easily, which she has noticed is a new development.

No new labs or imaging studies were performed at this visit.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Judy Gomez is a 62-year-old female with a past medical history significant for psoriatic arthritis, who presents today for ongoing management of her chronic problem.

Psoriatic arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms are being managed effectively with methotrexate. She has reported increased pain in her feet on days of greater activity, leading to occasional extra doses of prednisone.
• Medical Treatment: Plan to discontinue prednisone. Continue methotrexate.
• Patient Education and Counseling: Discussed the increased bruising as a side effect of prednisone, which should improve with discontinuation of the medication.

The patient will make an appointment for blood work to monitor the effects of methotrexate, a high-risk medication. We plan to follow up in three months to evaluate her progress off prednisone.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."
D2N105,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a 102-year-old female who presents today with concerns about a newly diagnosed heart murmur. She was referred by her primary care physician. She reports no chest pain but has noticed she gets short of breath if she walks too fast or too long, drinks a whole glass of water without stopping, or overexerts herself. She describes this symptom to have increased about 70 to 80% over the past six months.

In addition, she has been dealing with severe leg pains for the past month and has been taking pain medications for the same. She experiences dizziness, for which she has medication that she takes as needed. She denies any fainting spells or irregular heartbeats but notes that her ankles have been swelling on and off for about six months. 

She also reports a gradual weight loss over the past year (from her usual 130 pounds to her current weight of 120 pounds). She has been feeling increasingly tired, which she attributes to the medications she is taking. 

Her family history is significant for heart diseases, with her son experiencing a heart attack and her elder sister having heart problems.

Non-healing right foot wound.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Wayne is a patient with a history of diabetes who presents today with a non-healing wound on his right foot. The patient reports that the wound has been present for 2-3 weeks. He first noticed the wound after wearing new shoes, which were too tight and initially caused a blister. Despite the application of a band-aid and a completed course of antibiotics, the wound has not improved. He does not report any pain associated with the wound, likely due to neuropathy. He reports no recent fevers, chills, or drainage from the wound. However, he notes that his sock sometimes sticks to the wound. He no longer wears the offending shoes.

Wayne had been under the care of a podiatrist a couple of years ago but lost the connection when the doctor moved. His primary care physician has referred him to our office for further management of the wound.

His most recent hemoglobin A1c was slightly above 8, indicating suboptimal control of his diabetes.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of diabetes and neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient likes shoes from the brand Hoka, which he buys for their comfort and stability.

MEDICATIONS

Patient recently completed a course of antibiotics for the foot wound.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.
Respiratory: No reported issues.
Cardiovascular: No reported issues.
Neurological: Patient reports neuropathy.
Skin: Patient reports a non-healing wound on the right foot.

VITALS

Temperature: 98.1.
Blood pressure: 110/65
Heart rate: 72
Respirations: 16

PHYSICAL EXAM

Vascular: Bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses palpable. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses non-palpable, but Doppler signs present.
MSK/Skin: On the dorsal aspect of the right foot, lateral to the fifth metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, there is a 1x2 inch wound. Yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis, and no evidence of fluid collection or necrosis. No odor, and no bony exposure appreciated.

ASSESSMENT

1. Diabetic foot ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes Mellitus

PLAN

After a thorough review of Wayne's history and physical examination findings, I discussed the need for further intervention to facilitate wound healing. An ankle brachial index (ABI) will be ordered to evaluate the blood supply to his foot, which will help us understand his healing potential. I performed a debridement in the office to remove dead tissue from the wound and prescribed a daily application of collagenase ointment, to be covered with a dry sterile dressing. The dressing changes will continue until wound improvement is seen, characterized by wound shrinking and the presence of healthy granulation tissue. Wayne will wear a surgical shoe to alleviate pressure on the wound area. At present, no additional antibiotics are deemed necessary. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks to assess the wound progress.

Regarding his diabetes, I emphasized the importance of good blood sugar control for wound healing. I suggested a consultation with a diabetes specialist to provide guidance on dietary changes that might help improve his hemoglobin A1c levels. If the ABI results suggest suboptimal blood flow, a referral to a vascular specialist may be necessary.

We will review all findings and adjust the treatment plan as needed during his follow-up appointment."

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle, a 32-year-old female, presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury sustained during a skiing accident. The onset of her pain began last weekend when her ski caught as she was disembarking from the ski lift, leading to a fall. The patient describes a 'pop' in her knee at the time of injury and has had persistent pain since. She was unable to bear weight post-injury and required ski patrol assistance to descend the slope. Currently, her pain is most severe on the lateral aspect of her right knee, and she reports a feeling of instability, with her knee feeling as though it might 'buckle'. The patient has found that she is no longer able to bend her knee as easily as immediately post-injury, and straightening it causes significant pain. The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her toes and has full sensation. The patient has been using crutches provided by the ski patrol.

The patient describes herself as an active individual, engaging in skiing and running regularly, as well as chasing after her twin four-year-old children. The patient's husband is able to assist her, although his work often requires him to be away from home.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies any significant medical history, including hypertension or diabetes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, swelling, and instability. No other joint pain reported.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee reveals edema and an effusion. The patient experiences pain with palpation of the right lateral knee, reduced flexion and extension, and a positive Lachman sign. Pulses are palpable in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. No leg edema in the ankle.

CV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated.
Resp: Clear to auscultation.

IMAGING

A previous X-ray of the right knee showed no bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Suspected anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture of the right knee based on history and clinical examination.

PLAN

A lengthy discussion was held with the patient about her current symptoms. Despite her X-ray showing no fractures, the physical exam findings strongly suggest a possible ACL rupture. An MRI of the knee has been ordered to confirm this diagnosis and to assess if there is damage to any other structures. For pain management, the patient is to continue taking ibuprofen 600-800 mg every eight hours as needed. The patient will be fitted with a brace to provide additional knee support. Once the MRI results are available, a further discussion will be held regarding the best treatment course, potentially considering graft options should an ACL repair be necessary. The patient was also advised to avoid strenuous activity, including running and skiing, during this period. The patient understands the plan and has no additional questions at this time."

Annual Asthma, Allergic Rhinitis, and Food Allergy Follow-Up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female with a past medical history significant for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and a peanut allergy, here for her annual follow-up. It has been more than a year since I last saw her in-person, with the previous visit being conducted via telemedicine due to pandemic restrictions.

Due to insurance changes, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela in April 2020, which she has been taking without any issues at a 250/50 dose. She uses it once in the morning and once at night, with an additional use of an albuterol inhaler as needed before workouts or strenuous activities. Emily is planning on enlisting in the military and has therefore been trying to reduce her inhaler usage. Currently, she uses Wixela 3-4 times per week and on other days, it is once a day.

She also uses Zyrtec for her seasonal allergy symptoms in the spring and fall, and occasionally in the summer. She works outside about three days a week and takes Zyrtec on those days. She reports Zyrtec as being effective in controlling her allergy symptoms.

Emily has known peanut allergy but can tolerate almonds and cashews. She had a previous incident where she developed hives after coming into contact with peanuts at her workplace. Since then, she has been careful to avoid direct contact with peanuts. She has an EpiPen and needs refills for the year.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Respiratory: Denies any urgent care or ER visits for breathing issues over the past year.
• Allergies: Denies any recent allergic reactions. Endorses seasonal allergies managed with Zyrtec.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs sound clear.
• Cardiovascular: Heart sounds normal.
• ENT: Ears show a bit of wax on both sides. No abnormalities in the mouth or nose.

• Asthma Control Test (ACT) score: 21

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female with a past medical history significant for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and a peanut allergy here for her annual follow-up.

Asthma:
• Medical Reasoning: She has been trying to reduce her inhaler usage in preparation for military enlistment. She currently uses Wixela 3-4 times a week and other days once a day. She uses her albuterol inhaler before strenuous activities.
• Additional Testing: Breathing test conducted for comparison with previous years. Results show similar performance as a couple of years ago and a slight improvement from last test in 2019, likely due to smoke from wildfires at the time.
• Medical Treatment: Continue with Wixela or switch to a single medication inhaler, pending insurance approval.

Allergic Rhinitis:
• Medical Reasoning: She uses Zyrtec as needed, especially on days when she is outside for work.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Zyrtec as needed.

Food Allergy:
• Medical Reasoning: She continues to avoid peanuts and tree nuts, despite tolerating almonds and cashews. She carries an EpiPen for emergencies.
• Medical Treatment: Refill EpiPen.

Current blood pressure range: 146/155 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

General Examination: Unremarkable.
Cardiovascular: Heart sounds normal.
Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally.
Musculoskeletal: No pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Resistant Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Mr. Roberts has hypertension that is not adequately controlled despite being on three different medications at maximum doses. His age and early onset suggest possible resistant hypertension. His potassium levels were normal (4.0) at the last check.
- Medical Treatment: Plan to add Spironolactone to his regimen. The patient was educated about the potential side effects of the medication including electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, gynecomastia, and dizziness. He was instructed to remain hydrated and to report any side effects promptly. We will reassess his potassium and sodium levels in two weeks. 

2. Lifestyle Modification and Education.
- Patient Education and Counseling: Mr. Roberts was advised to follow the DASH eating plan and continue his physical activities, especially treadmill exercise. He was informed about the positive impact of these measures on blood pressure control. The patient was directed to the American Heart Association website for further information.
- Patient Agreement: The patient understood and agreed with the recommended lifestyle modifications and the addition of Spironolactone to his regimen.

If the addition of Spironolactone does not lead to better control of the patient's hypertension, consideration will be given to referral to a resistant hypertension clinic. Further evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension will be undertaken, and he may be considered for procedures such as renal denervation.

INSTRUCTIONS

Mr. Roberts is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks, with a metabolic panel and blood pressure check to monitor the effectiveness of the new treatment and monitor for any potential side effects."

Follow-up for adult hydrocephalus post-shunt surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Christopher Watson, an 86-year-old male, presents today for follow-up after undergoing shunt surgery for adult hydrocephalus on August 1, 2020. He was diagnosed with hydrocephalus in June 2020 following 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control.

The patient reports no recent sickness or hospitalization since surgery. His walking has improved; however, he still needs occasional assistance. His bladder control improved post-surgery but has since leveled out, requiring him to wear diapers with no reported complications. He reports an improved cognitive ability, now feeling more engaged in conversations. He reports no headaches or discomfort related to the shunt and no abdominal pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Mr. Watson is alert, cooperative, and able to converse with ease. His daughter is present to provide additional details. The shunt site appears clean, dry, and intact with a confirmed setting of two. His gait testing results, using the Tinetti assessment tool, show an improved total score of 18 to 20 out of 28 from the initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28.

RESULTS

A recent CT scan showed a small amount of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region, which wasn't previously documented by the radiologist. His MMSE scores showed slight improvement over his initial scores: 26 out of 30 when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations. The previous test results were 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling. The patient showed improved memory with cuing compared to previous tests.

ASSESSMENT

• Adult hydrocephalus post-shunt surgery.
• Improved gait impairment.
• Persistent urinary incontinence.
• Improved cognitive impairment.

CHIEF COMPLAINT
Patient reports her skin rash has improved but has plateaued.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Jacqueline had initially been taking doxycycline twice daily for her skin rash, which she reports led to improvement. However, she switched to a once-daily regimen on pharmacist advice, following which her progress plateaued. The patient has been using sulfacetamide wash twice daily and metro cream after face wash without any issue of skin dryness. She has not been using the Elidel, as she was concerned about potential side effects.

MEDICATIONS
- Doxycycline (initially twice a day, then reduced to once daily)
- Sulfacetamide face wash (twice daily)
- Metro cream (after face wash)

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
- Dermatological: Erythematous papules and slight redness around and under nostrils. No other rash, lesions, or dryness reported.

PHYSICAL EXAM
- Dermatological: Fitzpatrick skin type IV to V. Bilateral medial cheeks show a few faint erythematous papules and slight redness around and under nostrils. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1. Skin rash, not fully resolved.
- Medical Reasoning: Patient's rash improved with the initial use of doxycycline twice daily, but plateaued once reduced to once daily. The patient's topical applications did not cause any adverse effects and contributed to improvement.
- Patient Education and Counseling: Explained that topical Elidel's risks are minimal in cream form compared to oral. Advised patient that the ointment form of Tacrolimus could be an affordable alternative to Elidel, with similar effects and a different mechanism.
- Medical Treatment: Advised patient to resume twice-daily use of doxycycline and to continue using sulfacetamide wash and metro cream. A prescription for Tacrolimus ointment has been sent to the pharmacy, and the patient was instructed to apply it to the rash twice daily until resolved. 
- Other: The patient was also advised to moisturize her skin, protect herself from the sun due to photosensitivity from doxycycline, and to avoid steroids on her face. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS
The patient will continue her current regimen, adding the Tacrolimus ointment, and will follow up as needed. If the rash flares up again, the patient has been advised to try Tacrolimus for a few days, and if unsuccessful, to restart doxycycline."

Right heel and calf pain during and after exercise.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dennis, a fit male patient who presents today due to pain in the back of his right heel extending into his calf typically after workout or when he first wakes up in the morning. He has recently been training for a triathlon, involving a 10 km run in the mornings, 45 minutes to 1-hour bike ride at lunchtime, and 30 minutes to 1-hour swimming in the evening for five days per week. On the weekends, he alternates between long runs and long bike rides. He reports no stretching routine as he does not have the time for it. 

Upon rising in the morning, he experiences feelings of tightness and almost like tearing in the affected area which eases after around 10-15 minutes of walking. However, after sitting for an extended period, the pain and discomfort return. Also, after a lot of activity, the soreness increases.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient is a triathlon trainee.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right heel and calf pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Examination of the right leg reveals pain on toe flexion and resisted plantar flexion. No pain elicited on squeezing the left calf, and the Thompson test on the right side is negative. However, there is significant pain when squeezing the right heel, and the Achilles tendon is very tender to touch.

ASSESSMENT

Achilles tendinitis.

PLAN

Following the physical examination, we had a lengthy discussion about his current symptoms and exercise routine. We concluded that his symptoms were due to overuse from his rigorous triathlon training. He was instructed to stop training for a week or two to allow the area to heal. 

I have prescribed an anti-inflammatory regimen of ibuprofen, three tablets every six hours to alleviate the inflammation around the Achilles tendon. I have also ordered a couple of physical therapy sessions to help strengthen his lower extremities and learn proper stretching techniques. 

The patient was instructed to follow-up with me in 7-10 days after his first couple of physical therapy appointments for progress monitoring. In the case of persisting pain after this period with activity modification, we may need to look at more aggressive treatment plans.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient is to engage in physical therapy, take ibuprofen as directed, and cease training for a week or two. He will return for a follow-up in 7-10 days."

Bilateral knee pain lasting for about six months.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia is a young, active patient with no significant past medical history. She presents today with complaints of persistent bilateral knee pain for the last six months. The patient cannot recall any specific event or injury that initiated the pain. 

The patient describes the pain as a deep, achy sensation located behind her kneecaps, accompanied by creaking noises. Activities like transitioning from sitting to standing, ascending and descending stairs, and especially running exacerbate her symptoms. Rest provides some relief. She has tried at-home interventions such as ice and over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen and Aleve, but with limited success. 

Sophia was a passionate runner, averaging five to six miles per day, but due to her knee pain, her mileage has significantly reduced to less than half a mile. She denies any associated swelling, redness, or previous knee injuries. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees.
• Neurological: Denies headaches.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
• Musculoskeletal: Normal gait. No erythema, ecchymosis, or warmth noted in the knees. No effusion. Tenderness to palpation of bilateral retinaculum with a positive patellar grind test. Knee pain with squatting. Lachman anterior and posterior drawer and McMurray tests were negative bilaterally.
• Neurological: Symmetrical patella and Achilles reflexes.

RESULTS

Bilateral knee X-ray: No fractures or osteoarthritis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Sophia is a young, active patient presenting with complaints of persistent bilateral knee pain.

Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome.
• Medical Reasoning: Given her described symptoms, physical exam findings, and negative X-ray results, her presentation is consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome. This condition is common among active individuals and is often related to improper kneecap movement along the femoral groove.
• Medical Treatment: Sophia may continue to take ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatories as needed. Additionally, a referral for physical therapy is advised to strengthen lower extremities, increase mobility, and correct potential running mechanics that could be contributing to her pain.
• Patient Education and Counseling: The patient was advised to take a break from running for now. Our goal is to have her return to her regular running routine, but this will be determined based on her progress with the recommended treatments and interventions.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

Refractory acid reflux.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King, a 37-year-old female, presents for a new patient visit for ongoing acid reflux. Ms. King reports a longstanding history of acid reflux, dating back to when she was around 12 years old. Her symptoms, described as burning in her chest and throat, have worsened over the past few years. The patient denies having difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding. She does report certain triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, and carbonated drinks. The patient also mentions a recent lack of appetite, which she attributes to work stress.

Ms. King has been on omeprazole 40mg twice daily for about a year, with partial relief of her symptoms. She reported being on omeprazole and ranitidine in the past, which provided some additional relief. However, she has continued to experience periods of significant reflux.

She had a surgical intervention when she was an infant due to intestinal twisting. Her last upper endoscopy was performed more than a decade ago. Her family history is significant for esophageal cancer in her maternal grandmother and acid reflux in her mother.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

Abdomen
Normoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. Well-healed surgical scars noted.

ASSESSMENT

• Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
• History of anxiety and seasonal allergies

PLAN

Ms. King is a 37-year-old female presenting with ongoing, refractory GERD despite taking omeprazole 40mg twice daily. Given her history and physical exam, it is suspected she may have underlying functional etiology contributing to her GERD. She has no unintentional weight loss and denies dysphagia, both reassuring signs. 

GERD
• Recommend a trial of Nexium 40mg twice daily.
• Encourage dietary modification to avoid known GERD triggers.
• Stress management to help reduce symptom exacerbation.

Anxiety
• Discuss stress management techniques and, if necessary, refer for psychological support.

Upper endoscopy (EGD)
• Given her long history of GERD, family history of esophageal cancer, and recent worsening of symptoms, recommend scheduling an EGD to rule out pathological causes of her symptoms. 
• Follow-up in office after EGD to discuss results and adjust treatment plan as necessary.

If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtaining a pH-impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.

INSTRUCTIONS

Return to clinic in 4 weeks. Call the office if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop."

Follow-up post-hospitalization due to infection, spasms, lightheadedness, and constipation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 39-year-old female presenting for a follow-up appointment. She has a history of quadriplegia following a spinal cord injury. The patient was admitted to District Regional Hospital from 06/29/2021 to 07/02/2021 due to increased spasms, lightheadedness, significant constipation, and reported diaphoresis. She was febrile and had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000. Concerns were raised for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), but she was eventually discharged following improvement of her symptoms. She also presents with a supra-pubic catheter.

Upon review, the patient believes her symptoms were due to constipation rather than a UTI. She reported experiencing relief after a bowel movement post-discharge. The patient also questioned if autonomic dysreflexia could have impacted her white cell count, to which it was clarified that it typically does not. The patient reported feeling normal now.

PAST HISTORY

Quadriplegia due to spinal cord injury.
Significant constipation issues.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Miralax daily.

ASSESSMENT

• Post-hospitalization follow-up
• Quadriplegia due to prior spinal cord injury
• Constipation issues

PLAN

The patient was advised to return in a few weeks for a complete blood work, including white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol. This is both to confirm the normalization of the white cell count and because she is due for a cholesterol check. If the white count remains elevated, further investigation into bowel issues will be initiated.

The patient was advised about the use of lactulose in conjunction with Miralax for severe constipation issues. A discussion was held about the COVID-19 vaccine due to the patient's concerns about the unknown side effects. The patient currently remains unvaccinated, but it was recommended that, given her high-risk status due to her health condition, she should consider getting vaccinated.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient was advised to return in 2-3 weeks for a complete blood work. The patient was given instructions on using lactulose as a rescue medication for severe constipation. She was encouraged to continue taking Miralax daily and was educated about the benefits of getting the COVID-19 vaccine, given her high-risk status."

Ashley James is a 14-year-old female with a previously healthy medical history who presents today for the evaluation of an abnormal renal ultrasound revealing an atrophic right kidney. Her symptoms started with sudden onset of severe right-sided abdominal pain and vomiting. She was initially misdiagnosed with a stomach virus, but persistent and worsening symptoms led to further investigations. An ultrasound identified asymmetry in her kidney sizes, with the right kidney appearing smaller. Subsequent investigations also revealed cysts on her kidney and ovaries, and enlarged lymph nodes. Despite treatment, she continues to experience abdominal pain, describing it as a burning sensation especially after eating. The patient also reports occasional difficulty in initiating urination but denies any hematuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Negative for fever.
Gastrointestinal: Positive for abdominal pain and vomiting. Negative for diarrhea.

Recommendations include an annual ultrasound to monitor the size and function of her kidneys, annual urinalysis to check for proteinuria and hematuria, and regular blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and instead use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain management. Further genetic workup may also be needed considering the significant family history of renal disease.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 6 months, sooner if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop. If the abdominal pain persists or worsens, or if Ashley experiences any other concerning symptoms such as fever, unexplained weight loss, hematuria, or changes in urination patterns, she should seek immediate medical attention."

The patient presents with chronic back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient reports back pain persisting for a couple of years, which began after a fall during a basketball game. The pain is described as sharp and sometimes throbbing, rating a severity of 7/10. The patient reports radiating pain down the left leg, occasional numbness in the toes, and weakness when standing for extended periods. There was an isolated incidence of fecal incontinence, which the patient associates with standing for too long and alcohol consumption. The patient has previously received injections and physical therapy for this condition but found minimal relief. The patient's level of activity has decreased significantly, leading to weight gain of approximately 80 pounds over the past year.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

Noncontributory.

FAMILY HISTORY

A distant relative with scoliosis. No direct family members reported with spine conditions.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient admits to past smoking but is not currently smoking. Denies any specific substance usage.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: No complaints. 
Musculoskeletal: Reports chronic lower back pain, radiating to left leg with occasional numbness in toes. 
Neurological: Reports weakness after standing for long periods, reduced sensation in left leg. One instance of bowel incontinence.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Alert and oriented x3. Normal gait.

Neck
- General Examination: No JVD. No bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: No wheezes, rales.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No appreciable murmurs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Tenderness on the midline of the L4 L5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Positive supine straight leg test. Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at L4 dermatome. Symmetrical patella and Achilles reflexes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Chronic Lumbar Back Pain
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and previous MRI results showing disk desiccation, a disk bulge with paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis, the patient's chronic back pain is consistent with a herniated disk at the L4 L5 level with radiculopathy.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The diagnosis and possible treatment options were discussed with the patient.
- Medical Treatment: I plan to administer a spinal injection with a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and target the disk bulge directly. The patient expressed anxiety about injections, so I will prescribe a one-time anxiolytic medication to be taken before the procedure. If the pain persists after the injection, we will reconsider pain medication.
- Additional Testing: None needed at this stage. If the patient's condition doesn't improve post-injection, we may need to consider surgery as a last resort.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up visit is scheduled for a few days after the corticosteroid injection to monitor the patient's response and discuss further options if necessary."

Decreased vision, especially in dark environments and straight lines appearing wavy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient enjoys eating out, often in low-light environments. Smoker, approximately a pack a day, with failed previous attempts to quit. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Ocular: Reports decreased vision and distortion of straight lines. 
Cardiovascular: Has a history of hypertension, but patient admits to not consistently taking his prescribed blood pressure medication.

VITALS

Not provided.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Ocular:
- Anterior segment examination: Posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes, cornea clear in both eyes. No NVI, cup-to-disc ratio is 0.2 for the right eye and 0.3 for the left eye. 
- Posterior segment examination: Fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached 360 degrees with no holes or tears noted. RPE changes in the fovea. There is retinal thickening, subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation, and a positive hemorrhage in the right eye. The left eye shows no hemorrhage, subretinal fluid, and the retina is appropriately attached.

RESULTS

The Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) exam shows drusen deposits under the RPE and subretinal fluid (SRF) accumulation. Fluorescein Angiography reveals focal leakage in the right eye consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Wet Macular Degeneration)
- Medical Reasoning: The diagnostic test and the eye exam findings are consistent with wet macular degeneration, characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the retina, leaking fluid, and blood creating a large blind spot in the center of the visual field. The findings of drusen deposits under the RPE, subretinal fluid accumulation, and focal leakage further support this diagnosis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the disease was explained in detail, including the course of the disease and the treatment plan involving monthly injections of Lucentis into the vitreous part of the eye.
- Medical Treatment: A treatment plan of monthly Lucentis injections was recommended to slow the rate of vision decline. The first injection was administered on the day of the visit after numbing the eye. 

2. Hypertension
- Patient Education and Counseling: Emphasized the importance of taking the prescribed blood pressure medication regularly. The patient was advised to keep his medication in a visible location to improve adherence.
- Medical Treatment: The current medication plan for hypertension was maintained, the patient was advised to start taking the medication as prescribed.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

Joshua, a cooperative patient, presents to the clinic today for evaluation of suspected right-sided kidney stone. 

The patient has been experiencing intermittent right-sided flank pain radiating to his groin for the past two weeks. He describes the pain as variable, depending on his hydration status and activity level. He rates it as typically 1-2/10, but with episodes escalating to 4/10. There is no pain upon urination, and no hematuria observed. The patient had an episode where pain radiated to one of his testicles, but this symptom has since subsided. He has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen for pain, with partial relief. 

He denies any accompanying nausea or vomiting but did experience some chills without fever. The patient acknowledges a strong family history of kidney stones, and he himself has had them in the past, with some requiring surgical intervention and others passing spontaneously usually within a week.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Negative for fever. Positive for chills.
Gastrointestinal: Negative for nausea or vomiting.
Genitourinary: Negative for hematuria and painful urination.

VITALS

Blood pressure is slightly elevated, likely due to pain.
Other vitals within normal range.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: No tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. CVA tenderness noted on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right-sided kidney stone, with intermittent pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, the treatment plan was discussed. Given that the stone is 0.5 cm, the patient was advised to continue increasing fluid intake in hopes of passing the stone. The patient has been managing the pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen but requested stronger medication given the upcoming weekend. Prescription for Tramadol 50mg was given to help with breakthrough pain. 

The patient will continue to use the provided urine strainer to catch the stone when it passes. Blood tests including a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture will be ordered to evaluate for possible infection and other complications. Antibiotics will be considered based on the results. 

The patient is to return in 1-2 weeks for follow-up. If the stone has not passed or if the patient is still symptomatic, other treatment options such as lithotripsy will be considered, a procedure the patient is familiar with from prior experiences. 

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 1-2 weeks. Continue the use of the urine strainer and increased fluid intake. Use the prescribed Tramadol for breakthrough pain. Blood work will be scheduled. If pain increases or new symptoms occur, contact the clinic immediately."
