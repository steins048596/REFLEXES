P: i have been lifting more , um , probably around three times a week . so i do n't know if it was because i was doing deadlifts that day and then walked .

DIALOGUE:
D: um , hi mrs. anderson . right ?
P: yeah . yes , doctor .
D: what brings you here today ?
P: hi , doctor . um , i'm having this left shoulder pain lately , uh , and it's paining a lot .
D: okay . all right . hey , dragon . i am seeing mrs. anderson , a 44-years-old female , uh , complaining to check the left shoulder pain . um , so how long how has this lasted ?
P: it's been a week , doctor . yeah .
D: a week .
P: yeah .
D: um , did you take any medication yourself ?
P: no , i did not take any pain medications . actually , i did . i did take a tylenol for two or three days , but then that did n't help at all . so , uh , the reason why it started or when it started to happen is-
D: yeah .
P: . i was actually in gymnastics class .
D: yeah , okay .
P: and , uh , i do n't know . maybe i must have toppled over into some weird position , so it started to pain since then , uh , because of a certain move .
D: okay , uh-
P: i went overboard , i think . yeah .
D: all right , lem me , uh , take a quick look . uh , can you move up a little bit ? yeah .
P: uh , yeah . in fact , that's hurts .
D: does that- does it hurt ?
P: yeah , it does .
D: what if you move back a little bit ?
P: uh , that also hurts , doctor .
D: yeah , okay .
P: any kind of movement on my left shoulder actually hurts .
D: okay . all right , um , so let's ... hey , dragon . show me the last x-ray . all right , from the x-ray , it does n't look like there is any , uh , broken bone or fracture . my guess is you probably , um , hurt your joint , uh-
P: uh- .
D: . a little bit .
P: mm-hmm .
D: so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week .
P: and for how long ? yes .
D: for a week .
P: a week , okay .
D: and then if you ... if it's still painful , you can use , uh , ice or , um , heat pad-
P: okay .
D: . 'cause that might help relieve your pain .
P: okay .
D: um ...
P: but i wanted you to know that i did have past surgery on my , um , left arm-
D: mm-hmm .
P: . so , um , i hope that should n't matter , right ?
D: um , that does n't seem related to your pain .
P: okay .

P: okay .
D: . while it's healing .

P: can i , uh , carry any heavy weights or-
D: no , no . definitely not .

D: . for the next , uh , at least just three to four weeks .
P: mm-hmm .
D: uh , come back to see me if the pain , you know , still there after maybe three weeks-
P: sure .
D: . so we can take a further look .
P: okay . sure .
D: but you should be fine-
P: yeah .
D: . after just resting and regular pain reliever .
P: okay . all right .
D: um-
P: should we take another x-ray when i come back , if the pain does n't improve ?
D: um , maybe . let's see how you're doing in the next three weeks .
P: uh .
D: hey , dragon . um , order medications and procedures as discussed . all right .
P: okay .
D: um , i think that's good for today . hope you feel better soon .
P: okay . thank you , doctor .
D: yeah .
P: hopefully , the pain reliever , uh , ibuprofen actually helps .
D: yeah .
P: yeah , and if i have more pain , can i call you ? can i fix up another appointment earlier than three weeks ?
D: um , you can also try advil .
P: okay .
D: yeah , so , um ...
P: yeah .
D: ale- , aleve . i mean , aleve .
P: i see . okay , thank you , doctor .
D: thank you .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: okay . all right , lem me , uh , take a quick look . uh , can you move up a little bit ? yeah .
P: uh , yeah . in fact , that's hurts .
D: does that- does it hurt ?
P: yeah , it does .
D: what if you move back a little bit ?
P: uh , that also hurts , doctor .
D: yeah , okay .
P: any kind of movement on my left shoulder actually hurts .
D: okay . all right , um , so let's ... hey , dragon . show me the last x-ray . all right , from the x-ray , it does n't look like there is any , uh , broken bone or fracture . my guess is you probably , um , hurt your joint , uh-
P: uh- .
D: . a little bit .
P: mm-hmm .
D: so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week .
P: and for how long ? yes .
D: for a week .
P: a week , okay .
D: and then if you ... if it's still painful , you can use , uh , ice or , um , heat pad-
P: okay .
D: . 'cause that might help relieve your pain .
P: okay .
D: um ...
P: but i wanted you to know that i did have past surgery on my , um , left arm-
D: mm-hmm .
P: . so , um , i hope that should n't matter , right ?
D: um , that does n't seem related to your pain .
P: okay .
D: so ... but i would try to rest my , your left arm-
P: okay .
D: . while it's healing .
P: okay .
D: so , um-
P: can i , uh , carry any heavy weights or-
D: no , no . definitely not .
P: . anything like that ?
D: definitely not .
P: okay . okay .
D: yeah , use , um , right hand-
P: okay .
D: . instead-
P: mm-hmm .
D: . for the next , uh , at least just three to four weeks .

DIALOGUE:
D: all right . today i am seeing jose james . uh , date of birth 9/29/1957 . mr . james is a new patient who's having pain in his left shoulder and elbow . he fell five months ago going up a stairs , and the pain has been present since .
D: hi mr . james , i'm doctor isabella . how are you doing ?
P: i'm okay . thank you .
D: that's good . that's good . tell me what's brings you in today .
P: sure . so i've been having constant pain in my left shoulder and left elbow for a while , about five months or so . hurts all the time . pretty bad at times .
D: mm . that does not sound like fun . it sounds like you injured it going up the stairs ?
P: yes , that's correct . it was icy , and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house . i stepped and my feet just went out . fell on my left side . seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt . it's been hurting since .
D: yeah , that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms . anything seem to make the pain worse ?
P: well , i've always hit the gym and lifted weights . i've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week , but it's been hard . the pain is worse when i lift , and i have n't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating .
D: mm-hmm . i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine .
P: exactly . i really enjoy my exercise , but over the past one to two weeks , i've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just was n't worth it honestly . i do keep up with my walking , though . my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost every day . we have done this since i retired from my office job last year .
D: i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ?
P: not too much . i have iced a bit , but i have not taken anything for the pain . stopping exercise and some ice has helped a bit , but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you .
D: yeah , okay . how about any numbness or tingling ? have you felt that at any point ?
P: no , doc . just pain . no tingling or numbless , numbness , thankfully .
D: understood . understood . all right . well , let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
P: sounds good . thank you .
D: okay . use my general physical exam template . mr . james , i'm going to gently press around your shoulder and elbow here to see where your pain might be stemming from . just let me know when it hurts .
P: okay . it hurts when you press there on my elbow and here on my shoulder .
D: okay . left shoulder and elbow , tender sa space , no warmth , erythema or deformity . positive hawkins-kennedy and neer's test . normal proximal and distar , distal upper extremity strength . intact median radial ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees . normal empty tan , can test . okay , mr . james , w-what i think you are dealing with is impingement syndrome of your left shoulder . i do n't think there's an additional injury or issue with your wrist , but because everything is connected , you're experiencing pain in your wrist because of your shoulder . we do see this type of issue when someone has a fall , so it's good you came to see us , you came in to see us so we could help .
P: so what are the possible treatments ?
D: well , we have a few options you can try . first option would be to start with physical therapy . i would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home . we can start there and if that does n't improve your pain , then we could try a cortisone injection .
P: i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help . i am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .
D: all right . great . i'll get a referral order , and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled .
P: okay .
D: mm-hmm . also , please continue to ice , especially your shoulder , and rest as much as you can .
P: okay . i will .

D: all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
D: you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .
[patient_guest] okay .
D: actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
D: but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .
D: okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .
[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?
D: yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .
[patient_guest] okay .
D: now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .
[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .
D: yes , zarbee's .
[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?
D: i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .
[patient_guest] okay .
D: right , does that make sense ?
[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
D: okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .
[patient_guest] right , okay .
D: and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .
[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?
D: yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .
[patient_guest] okay .
D: yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , "" as needed , "" or anything like that .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .
D: you're welcome .
[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?
D: what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .
D: so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
D: all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .
[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .
D: good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .
[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?
D: correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .
[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .
D: you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?
P:it is , it is right now , yes .
D: okay . and , does he also have a cough ?
P:yes , but it's not barky .
D: i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .
D: okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?
P:yes , he did . yeah .
D: and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?
P:uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .
D: can you take a big breath randy .
P:where's mama ?
D: do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .
P:yeah , it's okay buddy .
D: excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .
P:okay .
D: all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .
P:hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .
D: okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .
P:all right . thank you .
D: all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
D: so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?
P:i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .
D: is it a dandruff shampoo ?
P:no , i do n't think so .
D: okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps ."

DIALOGUE:
D: kayla ward , date of birth , 4/28/07 . mrn 3-8-4-9-2-0 . she's here for a new visit with her mother for acne located on the face , which started about two years ago and is present most every day . she has been using persa-gel and washing regularly , which is somewhat helpful . there are no associated symptoms including itching , bleeding , or pain . no additional past medical history . she lives with her parents and sister . they have a dog , bird , and bunnies . she is in 7th grade . she plays basketball and volleyball and tap . she wears sunscreen in the summer , spf 30 . no additional family history . hi kayla , i'm dr. juan price . i hear you are starting to get some acne on the face . how about the chest and back ?
P: it's not too bad .
D: so , it's not bad on the chest or back . you've used some over the counter items like washes and persa-gel ?
P: yeah .
D: do those seem to be helping ?
P: yes , i think so , a little bit .
D: good . what's your skin care routine like now ?
P: do you wan na know , like , the things i currently use ?
D: yes . what do you do for your acne in the morning ? and then what do you do at nighttime ?
P: i wash my face , more like i wipe it down in the morning . then at night i use an elf facial cleanser called the super clarity cleanser . i finish with a toner and then the persa-gel .
D: when you say , "" wipe your face in the morning , "" do you use a product or just water ?
P: mm , just water and a washcloth , really . if i feel really greasy , sometimes i'll use the elf cleanser in the morning , too .
D: okay . and is today a good day , bad day , or an average day for you ?
P: mm , i would say it's probably a good day for me , of course , since i'm here , right ?
D: acne is always good when you come to see the doctor . do you find that your acne flares with your periods ?
P: no , not really .
D: and do you get a regular period ?
P: yup .
D: how long have you been getting a regular period ?
P: mm , i think about two years .
D: okay .
[patient_guest] the biggest flare , probably , was when she started school sports in the fall , just with all the sweating .
D: yup , that will do it . is there anything else that you've noticed , mrs. ward ?
[patient_guest] no . kayla really has been doing a good job with the facial care regimen . it just does n't seem to help as much as we wanted .
D: got it . okay . well , let's take a look then . full exam is performed today , except for under the underwear and under the bra . multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities . scattered skin colored papules . open and closed comedones . and erythmateous papules on the face , primarily on the forehead and with also some on the central cheeks and chin . the chest and back are relatively spared . and the remainder of the examination is normal . so , what i'm seeing from your exam today is mild to moderate acne , mostly comodonal with small inflammatory component .
P: okay , so is there anything we can do to help it ?
D: yes . i would like to start with a topical therapy first . every morning , you will wash your face with a mild cleanser then use a moisturizer labeled , "" noncomedogenic , "" with sunscreen spf 30 or higher . this means it wo n't clog your pores . now , in the evening , wash your face with the same cleanser and allow it to dry . apply adapalene , 0.1 % cream , in a thin layer to the areas you generally get acne . i want you to start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night . if it is ... excuse me , if it is very expensive or not covered by insurance , you can try different gel over the counter . you can follow that with clean and clear persa-gel in a thin layer , or where you generally get acne . and then a noncomedogenic moisturizer . you're atopic retinoid will cause some sensitivity , so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside . it may also cause some dryness or irritation .
P: okay , i can do that .
D: you also have multiple benign moles on your arms , legs , back and abdomen . this means they all look normal with no worrisome features . we will see if you have any progress over the next six months and follow up at that time .
P: okay , that sounds good . thank you .
D: do you have any questions for me ?
P: no , i do n't think so .
D: okay . if you have questions or concerns before your next visit , please call the office .
P: thank you , doctor , we will .

DIALOGUE:
D: patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .
P: nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?
D: i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?
P: yes . that's right .
D: okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?
P: no , i have n't .
D: okay . and how long have you been considering this ?
P: it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .
D: well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .
P: okay , that's reassuring .
D: yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .
P: okay . that sounds good .
D: and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?
P: i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .
D: okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?
P: most likely july .
D: okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .
P: okay .
D: so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?
P: well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .
D: okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?
P: i would say since i was in high school .
D: okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .
P: yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .
D: yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?
P: no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .
D: okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?
P: sometimes , yes .
D: okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .
P: no , but they are always sweaty .
D: okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?
P: there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .
D: and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?
P: y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .
D: that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?
P: mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .
D: okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?
P: yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .
D: congratulations . that's great . and then , um-
P: thank you .
D: . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?
P: uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .
D: okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .
P: yeah .
D: okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .
P: okay .
D: so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .
P: okay . that's fine .
D: and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .
P: right .
D: so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .
P: okay . well , thank you for explaining that .
D: you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .
P: okay .
D: and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .
P: okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .
D: okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .
P: okay , yeah , that sounds good .
D: okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .
P: okay .
D: and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .
P: yeah , okay .
D: and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .
P: yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .
D: okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .
P: okay , yeah . absolutely .
D: and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .
P: yeah , okay .
D: but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?
P: no , not really .
D: okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .
P: good . i look forward to a relief .
D: i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .
P: okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .
D: okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .
P: okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .
D: that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia , presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments , but the minimal relief , and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection , based on a bsa of 2.65 , with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams , which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a nipple graft .
D: physical exam findings of breast , inspection reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally . there is no nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally . no breast tenderness , masses , or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .

D: and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well ."

P: yes , ma'am .
D: well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything .
P: i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .
D: how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine .
P: um , at the time , i'd say an eight .
D: are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ?
P: no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .
D: that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ?
P: that's right .
D: all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time .
P: i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .
D: as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions .
P: yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .
D: you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day .
P: so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?
D: that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew .
P: okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?
D: great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork .
P: what's oxalate ?
D: it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products .
P: well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .
D: great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .
P: okay , good . i like to have things in writing to help me remember .
D: perfect . well , if you have any more questions . if you do n't have any more questions , you're all set . i wo n't need to see you back until next year , as long as you do n't have any more issues like bleeding or pain . if you do have any issues , you can always call the office sooner . and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine , you should go to the emergency room .
P: all right . well , let's hope we do n't have to do either of those and i see you next year .
D: yes , let's hope . come right this way and i'll walk you to check out . update pe abdomen . no flank pain . anti gu . normal vaginal exam . primary diagnosis is hematuria . secondary diagnosis is chronic urol ... urolithiasis . thank you . this completes mrs. wood encounter .

D: next patient is melissa sanchez . date of birth , 9/23/1962 . mrn : 5484367 . she is being seen in office today for status post mitral valve repair done on 8/3/2020 . at her previous follow-up on 9/17 , we felt that she was doing quite well from a cardiac standpoint , and so we recommended she continue with the same medication . ecg taken on 12/26/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response . t-wave inversion anteriorly . compared to the previous study , there are no significant changes , and please add in the history , patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation , history of diabetes , asthma , and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease .
D: ms. sanchez , it's good to see you again .
P: yeah , it's good seeing you too dr. hughes . you look like you're doing well .
D: i am , thank you . you too . you're looking great . how have you been feeling ?
P: pretty good . i'm definitely feeling better , thank goodness . i was having a rough time before surgery , um , but i think i'm overall pretty good now though .
D: okay . well , that's really good to hear . i'm glad . are you having any new symptoms right now ?
P: no , not really . but , you know , i'm still getting some chest pains sometimes , and my breathing gets shallow . but , i guess i'm learning what i can and ca n't do . uh , so if i feel like that , if i'm , like , exerting myself , i slow down a bit which helps , and then when i go back to it later , i can usually finish whatever i was doing .
D: okay . so , it does go away though ? how long does an episode seem to last ?
P: uh , only a few minutes i guess . then it disappears for a while . it's weird .
D: what is a while ?
P: it goes away for a couple weeks . um , so when it happens , i just take the day nice and slow , i do n't push myself .
D: okay . so , maybe it's a couple times a month you feel this way ?
P: yeah , just often enough for me to notice .
D: understood . okay . are you taking your medications regularly ?
P: uh- . i've been trying to keep up with that . there's a lot of extra pills now , but i have a reminder app , so i do pretty well .
D: okay . that's great . and so , you're taking coumadin , right ?
P: yeah , also lasix and the atenolol .
D: are you having any side effects from the medications at all ?
P: not really . uh , i notice that the atenolol is making me irritable in the beginning , but i guess i've gotten used to it , does n't seem to bother me as much now .
D: okay . well , that sounds good . sounds like you're well on the mend . so , why do n't i start out , um , with the physical exam , and just check you out .
P: okay .
D: you're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as i go to reference later for my notes .
P: okay .
D: okay then . i'm going to be using my status post template , ms. sanchez , please lie down on the table here and we'll get started . all right . can you turn your head to the left . head and neck no jvd detected . you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please . okay , that's good . and lungs have reduced breath , but auscultation and percussion are clear . okay . breath normally , i'm just going to listen to your heart . rhythm is irregularly irregular .
P: that's a funny statement . what does that mean ?
D: yeah , it does sounds kind of weird , right ? it's when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm , and whatever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it . so , it's part of the atrial fibrillation .
P: wow , that sounds like a mess .
D: yeah , it's not ideal . but , many people have a-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes .
P: agh , i see . that's good to know .
D: okay . so , s1 slightly accentuated , no s3 . i'm going to touch your belly , and does any of that hurt .
P: nope .
D: how about there ? and your feet ?
P: no , not really .
D: okay , great . and trace peripheral edema on extremities . all right ms. sanchez , you can sit up now . so , it looks like your heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely .
P: good .
D: yes . we are , we looked at your ecg taken earlier today , and we are seeing the a-fib , but it's being well controlled with the medicine , and you're taking coumadin , four milligrams , lasix at four milligrams a day , and the atenolol , you're taking that every day as well , right ?
P: yes . the 50 milligrams every day .
D: great . it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery .
P: great .
D: so , let's continue on your current meds . i'm glad that you're figuring out what your body can handle . definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help .
P: i'll do my best .
D: and that's about it . do you have any questions for me ?
P: um , i do . when do i need to come back and get checked out ?
D: well , i do n't think you need to come back soon . everything from a cardio perspective is fine . so , i think let's do a followup in about six to nine months .
P: all right , thank you . it was good to see you again dr. hughes .
D: you as well ms. sanchez , do take care .
P: you too .

P: i'm doing good , thank you . how are you ?
D: i'm great , thanks . so how have you been since the last time ? i know the last time we were talking about decreasing your prednisone dose , correct ?
P: yes . i'm just on one now and that seems to be enough .
D: aw , that's great to hear .
P: yeah , there were a couple days there i took an extra one , just because there was a little extra pain in my feet . and i do have a desk job , so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more .
D: okay . how many times did you do that ?
P: um , it was n't often , maybe once a week .
D: okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ?
P: yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot .
D: okay . and what happened ?
P: i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later .
D: i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ?
P: well , i called into the hotline because i was in so much pain with the first one . and they said , "" no , just go ahead and take it , "" so i did .
D: okay . that's good then . we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high-risk medication . do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time ?
P: no , they did n't give me one .
D: okay . so we can do that for you too . uhm , so what questions do you have for me , judy ?
P: well , i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here , so like when i bump myself . i do n't know where they're coming from .
D: okay . that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising .
P: okay . i did n't know that . um , i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up .
D: yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away .
P: okay . that sounds good , thanks .
D: okay , judy , please , um , sit up here and i'll take a look . shoes and socks off please .
P: all right .
D: all right . let me see here . okay . so where is it hurting ? in your joints right here ?
P: yeah , a little . also in my feet joints as well .
D: okay . and how about when you bend the knee like this ?
P: well , it hurt before we increased the methotrexate , but it's doing pretty good now .
D: okay , good . can you flex your toes please ? good range of motion . also ridges in nails , that's from the psoriasis .
P: yeah . they've been like that for a long time now .
D: okay . all right , uhm , ms gomez , it looks like we're moving along with your treatment nicely . we'll stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate . make sure to stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work , and i'll see you in three months .

DIALOGUE:
D: patient's name is diana scott . date of birth , 12/8/1920 . the date of service is 7/9/2021 . this is a new patient note .
D: good afternoon . how are you today ?
P: i'm good , thank you .
D: good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?
P: well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .
D: okay .
P: so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .
D: okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?
P: yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .
D: got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?
P: i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .
D: okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?
P: no , i definitely do n't .
D: okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?
P: no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .
D: okay .
P: and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .
D: okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?
P: if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .
D: okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?
P: well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .
D: got it . all right .
P: so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .
D: okay .
P: then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .
D: okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?
P: i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .
D: okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?
P: my legs have been severe for about a month now .
D: okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?
P: yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .
D: okay .
P: yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .
D: okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?
P: no .
D: okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?
P: i do n't notice it at all .
D: okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?
P: yeah , my ankles swell .
D: okay . and how long has this been going on ?
P: um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .
D: okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?
P: um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .
D: mm-hmm . okay .
P: um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .
D: okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?
P: no .
D: good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?
P: yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .
D: okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?
P: i'm not really sure .
D: okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?
P: yeah , you name it .
D: all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?
P: yes .
D: okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?
P: it was actually my son , not my brother .
D: okay , i'll make that adjustment .
P: um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .
D: okay , i see .
P: yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .
D: okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?
P: correct .
D: all right . well , let's do a quick exam .
P: all right . sounds good .
D: all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?
P: no , i feel fine .
D: okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .
P: okay .
D: all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .
P: okay .
D: and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .
P: yes , that's fine . i have time .
D: okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .
P: okay .
D: and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .
P: okay .
D: and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .
P: well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .
D: yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .
P: i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .
D: yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .
P: okay , good .
D: and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .
P: really ?
D: yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .
P: okay , that sounds great . thank you .
D: you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .
P: okay , i will .
D: all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?
P: not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .
D: okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon .
D: for physical exam , constitutional elderly otherwise no acute distress . cardiovascular normal s1 and s2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm . there is a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with , uhm , mild radiation to the carotids . neurologic gait is normal for age .
D: for assessment and plan , probably one cardiac murmur . diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids . this is most likely representative of aortic stenosis , for symptoms could be due to severe aortic , aortic stenosis . however , her s2 is relatively preserved , which would be more consistent with , consistent with moderate . some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction , so it is possible she , she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past . she does not appear significantly volume overloaded today .
D: her next problem is pvcs . her referral mentioned tachycardia . uh , her ekg today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs , as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern . she does not have any significant palpitations and we will check an echocardiogram to assess overa- overall cardiac structure and function . depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis , we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation , or further , possibly a heart mon- monitor to assess overall burden of the pvcs . at this point , she's asymptomatic , so we will start with the echocardiogram only .
D: her next problem , hypolipidemia , is managed by her pcp . due to bilateral leg pain over the last month , considered tavr evaluation following echocardiogram . statin could be indicated .
D: and next problem , lightheadedness , dizziness . she is on meclizine for this . it is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aorta stenosis , and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above . pvcs on her ekg could be contributing , but she does not feel palpitations . we will consider a monitor , but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above . follow up three to four weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps . end of dictation .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?

DIALOGUE:
D: so bryan it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on
P: i was in my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot
D: alright have you ever had this type of back pain before
P: i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day
D: okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing
P: put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help
D: okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing
P: yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit
D: okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately
P: i i i normally do n't do any physical activity
D: yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt
P: it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes
D: okay how about when you stand back up
P: no pain
D: okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back
P: yeah that hurts
D: okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that
P: what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts
D: okay and and what's your relationship
P: partners
D: okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up
P: i've spent so many times you know who i am
D: so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is
P: i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts
D: okay so you think this is more of a long term injury
P: no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't
D: okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back
P: i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him
D: that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands
P: can you repeat that
D: if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back
P: i
D: alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg
P: that would be my right leg
D: okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before
P: i have not taken meloxicam
D: alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan
P: it sounds reasonable
D: alright
P: i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it
D: alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving
P: good answer

D: okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before
P: i have not taken meloxicam
D: alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan
P: it sounds reasonable
D: alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving"

DIALOGUE:
D: hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it
P: sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed
D: okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden
P: i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach
D: okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics
P: they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet
D: okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you
P: i do n't recall the name exactly
D: do n't recall alright
P: something i had taken it before
D: okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it
P: i'm sorry
D: so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot
P: at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance
D: dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt
P: it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red
D: okay
P: i have n't had that before
D: okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled
P: i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time
D: okay do you
P: i'm not really sure how
D: okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it
P: i think they told me it was around ten
D: around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt
P: no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct
D: okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening
P: they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me
D: okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound
P: that sounds great
D: alright do you have any other question
P: i do if anything happens in between
D: please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks

DIALOGUE:
D: okay hi wayne well i understand you're here for you've got a sore on your foot that's not healing is that right
P: yes
D: so can you tell me about that how are you doing
P: well i've been doing okay but i've had this wound on my right foot for a couple of weeks and it's not getting better i saw my pcp and they referred me to you i i used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago but they moved and i was n't able to get another one
D: okay and how long have you had the wound
P: about two to three weeks
D: okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot
P: no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and
D: okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot
P: yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though
D: okay now does it hurt
P: no i ca n't feel it
D: okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines
P: no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on
D: okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem
P: no i'm upset
D: i'm so upset too i love those shoes
P: no i'm so upset i i love those shoes
D: okay so what kind of shoes are they
P: they're hoka's
D: ah so where did you get them
P: i got them at rei couple of years ago
D: they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they
P: yeah
D: so what do you like about them
P: they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability
D: that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or
P: yes
D: okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing
P: i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight
D: okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here
P: no it's okay
D: okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay
P: okay
D: okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay
P: okay
D: alright do you have any other questions
P: no
D: okay

D: okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay
P: okay
D: okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay
P: okay"

DIALOGUE:
D: hey william so i see that you injured your knee could you tell me a bit about what happened

D: okay alright and so do do you go to the trampoline park often
P: i do n't and i think that's the issue
D: okay so this is the first time you'd ever done something like that
P: yes
D: okay alright i just wan na get like a few more details do you like work out regularly was this for fun or for like an exercise class
P: no it's just for fun
D: okay and do you have like a regular exercise regimen at all
P: try to not consistent with it
D: okay no that's fine this is not a place of judgment i just i'm just trying to understand like if a little bit more of the background okay so we went to the trampoline park which knee where did you hurt
P: my right
D: okay your right knee and so based on like your inside and outside which part hurts more
P: it's kind of the outside of the knee
D: alright so the lateral aspect not a problem and you said that you heard a pop when you landed right
P: yeah
D: okay have you taken anything for the pain
P: just tylenol
D: alright so did the tylenol help
P: not really
D: okay alright and so hmmm when does it have you tried anything else like did you ice it use heat anything like that
P: no i just kinda elevated it and that was about it
D: okay that's fine and how long ago did this happen
P: a week ago
D: okay alright so you put up with the pain for a week that's i'm proud of you for that
P: i do n't like to come to the doctors
D: excuse me i feel rejected right now why why would you say something like that it's fine but you know i i like it when you're not here either because that means that you're doing a good job so let's see about like getting your knee fixed up but i want to talk about some of the other issues that you have first so we know that you have hypertension right and i discussed maybe you getting a blood pressure cuff because i needed you to measure those a bit more regularly did you get the cuff
P: what no
D: no okay that's fine have you measured your blood pressure recently at all
P: no
D: okay are you still taking your medication because i see you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril
P: yeah most days i remember
D: okay
P: ra i'm not suspicious but we're just gon na go with that okay because looking at your vitals it it is of still a bit high i'm not really comfortable i see like a hundred and eighty over you know eighty and
D: that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars
P: i think they're little bit better
D: okay what makes you think that have you been taking them
P: yeah i check it you know most days again kinda when i remember
D: okay how often are you checking it
P: i would say four five times a week
D: okay you might wan na switch to maybe two or three times a day but you know that's something i'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin
P: yes
D: okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct
P: yes
D: alright how is your diet
P: kinda the same as my exercise decent could be better
D: alright and okay not a problem so what is your do you are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros are you just eating what you feel like
P: yeah just trying to watch what i eat more than anything but nothing specific
D: okay and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet
P: no just trying to watch my carbs a little bit more but not counting or anything
D: alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet
P: no
D: okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt
P: little bit
D: okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt
P: no
D: alright can you bend your knee and straighten it
P: i can i think that's all i can i can bend
D: mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight
P: i can but i have a little bit of a limp
D: okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions

DIALOGUE:
D: hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today
P: pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse
D: okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there
P: well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time
D: so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version
P: well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden
D: okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at
P: yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month
D: okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes
P: yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here
D: okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me
P: it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg
D: okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life
P: right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten
D: okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better
P: yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down
D: okay
P: you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today
D: okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs
P: you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well
D: that's okay
P: to explain but this is what i deal with every single day
D: absolutely
P: lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them
D: so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here
P: no it's right here
D: okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there
P: it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks
D: okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please
P: okay that's it that's all i got
D: alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan

D: i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising
P: okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the

D: okay
P: now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here

D: yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery
P: not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment
D: okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week

D: okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan

D: yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that

P: kills
D: okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you
P: yeah it hurts a little bit
D: okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever
P: no i do n't think so
D: okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me
P: it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it
D: yeah yeah well

D: alright are you still having pain
P: nope
D: yeah
P: the pain's gone
D: okay that that's that's that's really good did they do anything for you at the hospital giving you any medications
P: they gave me some pain medicine
D: okay do you remember what it was
P: i think it was percocet
D: okay well that's good i'm very glad to see that you were able to pass that stone have you seen a urologist before about this
P: i have n't seen one in a while but yes i saw someone maybe a year ago
D: okay so yeah i know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones so i definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also wan na do some labs as well
P: okay
D: so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc
P: hmmm
D: now have you been taking that regularly
P: i have but at home my blood pressure is always great
D: okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy
P: okay
D: that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control
P: yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know
D: okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out
P: yeah i do n't know i do n't know if i can make another appointment i just add to the extra
D: okay
P: less time to make food so
D: yeah yeah definitely understand
P: mm-hmm
D: alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on
P: mm-hmm
D: so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well
P: yeah i take my metformin
D: okay
P: yeah
D: so what have your blood sugars been running daily
P: well i do n't check it very often
D: okay
P: but i think they've been pretty good
D: okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today
P: no
D: alright any any belly pain
P: no
D: alright so i'm gon na listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and we already knew about that previously so it has n't gotten any worse so that's good so i'm gon na just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones does that hurt
P: no
D: alright i'm gon na press here on your back
P: no pain
D: okay so on your abdomen exam of your abdomen i'm showing no tenderness to palpation of the abdomen or tenderness of the the cva either on the right side so that that's good i think that's pretty much cleared up so let's we'll talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you and so my assessment you you did have the those kidney stones but i i think they are passed this time but i do want to get a couple of labs so we'll get a urinalysis
P: okay
D: alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology
P: okay
D: because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control
P: can i see doctor harris
D: of course yeah we can we can get you that road to doctor harris and
P: he's not like
D: he's great he's he's he he he's great i've heard he does really good work so that'll be good so for the hypertension you seem to be doing well on the two . five of norvasc so we are not gon na make any changes to that do you need any refills right now
P: no usually the pharmacy just sends them through when i call
D: okay great so we we wo n't we gave you refills with that i do wan na give you a consult to nutrition
P: okay
D: just to help you with that diet
P: okay
D: because i think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications
P: hmmm
D: and then for your diabetes i'm just keep you on that on that five hundred of metformin okay i think you're doing well with that as well also but i do want you to start taking your blood sugars if you can take them before every meal
P: okay
D: just to gauge where you are so you can tell how much food you should actually be be eating
P: okay
D: alright
P: i can try that

DIALOGUE:
D: hey betty how are you doing
P: i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing
D: i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms
P: i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since
D: okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems
P: it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department
D: wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now
P: i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work
D: okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or
P: yes yes that's the name of it
D: is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that
P: i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well
D: okay and then when you use it at that time does it help
P: it does
D: okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs
P: yeah i take i usually take two puffs
D: okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep
P: yeah for the most part
D: okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er
P: yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then
D: okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those
P: yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone
D: okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing
P: yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days
D: okay
P: and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days
D: okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay
P: yeah
D: and then when was your last exacerbation
P: probably about a month ago
D: okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that

D: okay
P: and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work
D: i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially
P: you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend
D: okay and now can you describe the pain for me
P: yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe
D: okay
P: and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah
D: okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain
P: yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot
D: okay
P: let me separate these
D: and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area
P: no nothing like that
D: okay now do you have any weakness
P: i would n't say i have any weakness no
D: okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels
P: no
D: okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they
P: so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery
D: okay sure so tell me what is your day like
P: my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years
D: okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf
P: yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back
D: yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
P: exactly
D: well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions
P: no i ca n't recall any family members

P: not now i i quit about twenty years ago
D: okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here
P: okay
D: i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit
P: okay that's painful

P: is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time
D: well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year
P: okay okay
D: alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour
P: okay
D: okay
P: alright sounds good

P: i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days
D: nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing
P: not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it
D: okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
P: no just the swelling and the pain

P: i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day
D: okay and
P: putting a cold pack on it
D: okay and has that helped at all
P: yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though
D: okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here
P: i had my tonsils out
D: okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press
P: yeah that's sore
D: okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt
P: yeah do n't do that anymore
D: alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that
P: yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan
D: i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions

D: so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good.
D: now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process.

DIALOGUE:
D: so tyler is a 56 -year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem
P: well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking
D: okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing
P: no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down
D: okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that
P: i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids
D: okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that
P: it's really just about solids
D: okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all
P: no
D: okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all
P: not that i want
D: okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this
P: no
D: okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going
P: i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise
D: okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all
P: yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time
D: and how are the numbers looking
P: they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting
D: okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that
P: no

DIALOGUE:
D: so jerry is a 45 -year-old male who came in today with an ankle injury jerry what happened
P: hey doctor michael yeah so my son sean i think you met in the past he he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen
D: yeah
P: and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym
D: okay
P: and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so
D: absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way
P: he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys
D: good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad
P: yeah yes
D: okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too
P: yeah a little bit
D: okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all
P: yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid

DIALOGUE:
P: miss edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain this is a 54 -year-old male
D: how're you doing doctor cruz nice to see you today
P: good to see you mister edwards i'm doctor
D: tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you
P: okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that
D: had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area
P: mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face
D: not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face
P: no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face
D: have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it
P: sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes
D: sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it
P: okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you
D: pain excess
P: you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work
D: but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon
P: got it how long do these episodes last these pain
D: you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes
P: any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know
D: no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different
P: how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten
D: when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you
P: sure
D: i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth
P: that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that
D: yep
P: you can hear it on the other side as well
D: yep
P: okay
D: i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay
P: yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side
D: okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal
P: it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp
D: alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri
P: okay
D: and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia
P: okay
D: where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it
P: well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin
D: or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve
P: okay
D: most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first
P: for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve
D: okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this
P: sure
D: it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic
P: skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you
D: okay sounds good let's do it
P: okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain
D: yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not
P: i think one month would be a great time to follow up
D: okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there
P: great i'll see you then

P: my lawyer told me to come here
D: then you're stuck with me okay i'm so sorry but here it's we're gon na try and make it as good as possible alright so last thing i do wan na do my physical exam alright and i need you to let me know as as much as you as much as you can verbalize right so when i push here in the middle of your neck on top of the bone does it hurt
P: yes yes
D: okay alright sorry what about on the side does that hurt
P: yes
D: okay so pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle can you move your neck from side to side can you move your neck can you swive it side to side no no alright so i'm i'm seeing i'm seeing some range of movement moderate range of movement that's fine okay i so when can you bend your neck forward that that's your whole body just just the neck are you capable of bending up
P: really hurts it really hurts
D: okay it really hurts to bend forward and backwards okay alright so i'm just gon na make a little note here i do n't i do n't see any bruising i'm not noticing any swelling there is i i do n't see any laceration what
P: just sometimes it bruises
D: okay sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired
P: well since the accident yes
D: okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately
P: it hurts it hurts
D: absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that
P: thinking are are you saying i'm thinking
D: no not by any means i am saying
P: pain i have a lot of pain
D: yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay
P: yes
D: alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible
P: said it might be broken
D: what
P: pamela said it might be broken
D: if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right
P: okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri
D: not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin
P: hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl
D: you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this
P: i ca n't go to work like this
D: okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now

D: okay .
P: . in my right knee .
D: just in your right knee ?
P: yeah .
D: okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ?
P: yeah , it's only while swimming. i use the breaststroke so i guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog ... it kinda starts hurting a little bit after i swim a couple laps , which a month ago when i started i was able to do ten .
D: okay .
P: but after a couple of laps it starts to hurt .
D: and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?
P: no , not that i can remember .
D: okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?
P: yeah .
D: okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?
P: yeah , it comes and goes , but right now it's been doing really well .
D: okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ?
P: no .
D: okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ?

P: no .
D: okay , good . um , and the , you had ca- carpal tunnel done a few years ago . how's that doing ?
P: that's doing-
D: any flare up with that ?
P: . that's doing really well . i've been getting full range of motion and it's felt a lot better .
D: okay , great . do you mind if i do a quick exam ?
P: yeah , go for it .

P: okay .
D: um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break .

P: yes . so , i've been eating a ton of sweets recently . with the holidays it just feels like there is always something sweet available. whether i am at work and there are holiday gift baskets or clients bringing in treats or when i visit my family for the holidays and there is every baked good imaginable, there is always something sweet i can be eating. in the beginning i felt fine, but i have started to feel it after a couple of weeks, and this past week i just felt really light-headed and i could ... was seeing spots , really dizzy . so i went into the emergency room and they said i had a high blood sugar . um , so i wanted to come in and follow up with you to get that , um , get checked out .
D: okay . all right . and how , how are you feeling now ? did they , did , did they treat you in the emergency room ? did they gi- they give you some iv fluids and things like that ?

D: okay , all right . and , um , any pins and needles in your feet at all ? any swelling in your legs ?

DIALOGUE:
D: next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
D: hi emily , how are you ?
P: i'm pretty good , how are you ?
D: i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
P: yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
D: okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
P: yes , correct .
D: perfect . so how does that compare ?
P: i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
D: and that's one puff twice a day ?
P: mm-hmm .
D: okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
P: rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
D: so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
P: yes .
D: okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
P: yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
D: okay .
P: and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
D: no kidding , that's great .
P: yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
D: really ?
P: yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
D: and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
P: mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
D: and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
P: probably about three or four .
D: okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
P: yes , that's correct .
D: okay .
P: and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
D: okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
P: i do .
D: great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
P: nope .
D: okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
P: nope .
D: okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
P: so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
D: now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
P: correct .
D: okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
P: yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
D: do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
P: yeah , that's right .
D: okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
P: not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
D: and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
P: yeah , it does , it works great .
D: wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
P: yep , that's correct .
D: okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
P: no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
D: super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
P: yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
D: okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
P: yes .
D: okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
P: yeah , okay .
D: and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
P: i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
D: okay .
P: and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
D: okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
P: okay .
D: and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
P: all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
D: it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
P: okay .
D: yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
P: all right , that sounds good .
D: well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
P: okay .
D: all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
P: ahh .
D: good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
P: okay .
D: and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
P: awesome .
D: so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
P: i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
D: yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
P: correct .
D: okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
P: yeah i do know that .
D: okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
P: mm-hmm
D: so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
P: okay .
D: that we had too much , yeah .
P: okay .
D: um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
P: okay , that actually sounds really good .
D: okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
P: all right
D: okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
P: okay , got it .
D: and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
P: okay .
D: is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
P: yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
D: okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
P: awesome , thank you .
D: you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
P: i just get it over the counter .
D: okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
P: i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
D: okay good . well i think we have our game plan .
P: okay awesome .
D: and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .
P: okay
D: all right so we've got it .
P: great .
D: all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .
P: okay sounds good .
D: all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .
P: you too .
D: and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
P: okay .
D: all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .

P: i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
D: yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
P: correct .
D: okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
P: yeah i do know that .
D: okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med ."

D: martha is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure , depression and hypertension who presents for her annual exam . so , martha , it's been a year since i've seen you . how are you doing ?
D: let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your RESULTS, okay ? hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the result of the echocardiogram that we did last year .
D: um , hey , dragon , SHOW me the lipid panel . so , looking at your lipid panel from last year , you know , everything , your cholesterol was like , a tiny bit high . but it was n't too , too bad , so i know you're trying to watch your diet . so , we'll repeat another one this year , okay ?
D: um , so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ? so , for your first problem your congestive heart failure , um , i wan na continue you on your current medications . but i do wan na increase your lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day.
P: okay .
D: i also wan na repeat another echocardiogram , okay ?
P: all right .
D: hey , dragon , order an echocardiogram . from a depression standpoint , it sounds like you're doing really well with that . so , i'm , i'm really happy for you . i'm , i'm glad to see that you're in therapy and you're doing really well . i do n't feel the need to start you on any medications this year , unless you feel differently .

P: okay .
D: okay . do you have any questions ?
P: can i take all my pills at the same time ?
D: yeah .
P: 'cause i've been trying to take them at different times of the day , 'cause i did n't know if it was bad to take them all at once or i should separate them . i do n't know .
D: yeah . you can certainly take them , you know , all at the same time , as long , as yeah , they're all one scale . you can take them all at the same time . just set an alarm-
P: okay .
D: . some time during the day to take them , okay ?
P: that might help me remember better .

DIALOGUE:
D: all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3/2/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 .
D: hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?
P: i'm fine , thank you .
D: good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .
P: yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .
D: yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?
P: uh , no .
D: okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .
P: well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .
D: do you have a family history of this ?
P: yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .
D: i see .
P: yeah , i thought it was getting better , and , uh , i have a new primary doctor , and she put me on a new medication about a month ago .
D: uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?
P: my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .
D: okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .
P: yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .
D: okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?
P: uh , yes i am .
D: that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?
P: um , every day .
D: awesome .
P: yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .
D: so you're not down in the 120s yet ?
P: no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .
D: okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?
P: i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .
D: good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .
P: sounds good .
D: are you doing any exercise ?
P: i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .
D: okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .
P: all right .
D: uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .
P: okay .
D: so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .
P: all right .
D: your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .
P: good to hear .
D: all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .
P: nope . nowhere .
D: all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .
P: all right .
D: all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
P: uh , no .
D: okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
P: okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?
D: um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
P: all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
D: okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
P: all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
D: yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
P: all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
D: uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
P: i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
D: okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
P: i understand .
D: yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
P: okay .
D: um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
P: really ? i did n't realize that .
D: yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
P: okay . i'll definitely check that out .
D: all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
P: all right .
D: all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
P: that's interesting .
D: yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
P: sounds good to me .
D: all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .
P: sounds good . thanks doc .
D: yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .
P: will do .
D: all right . have a great day mr. roberts .
P: you too .
D: mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .

DIALOGUE:
D: brittany edwards , 07 , 1898 . she is a return visit for ibs with functional abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting . ms. edwards is a pleasant , 32-year-old female who was last seen in august of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl .
D: she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started .
D: hello , how are you ?
P: i'm okay .
D: good . how have you been feeling ?
P: not so good .
D: yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .
P: yeah , i have .
D: okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .
P: no , it does n't like it at all .
D: yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .
P: i've been getting both .
D: okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?
P: i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .
D: okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?
P: um , they're formed .
D: okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?
P: yeah , i do .
D: okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?
P: uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .
D: okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .
P: but it normally does n't bother me .
D: okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?
P: no .
D: okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?
P: most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .
D: sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?
P: um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .
D: okay . and how is it during the week ?
P: like what i eat ?
D: yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .
P: right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .
D: and was everything all right after that ?
P: yeah , for the most part .
D: okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .
P: okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .
D: sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .
P: sounds good .
D: all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .
P: okay .
D: all right . do you have any tenderness ?
P: no , not really .
D: okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .
D: all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .
P: okay , that sounds good .
D: okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .
P: can i get a refill of that ?
D: yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .
P: yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .
D: okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .
P: okay .
D: okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .
P: okay , i can do that .
D: okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
P: i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
D: yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
P: that sounds like a much better plan .
D: okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
P: okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
D: you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?
P: okay , that sounds good . thank you .
D: you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .
D: so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs .
D: she can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed . however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects and issues , or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .

DIALOGUE:
D: okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04/12/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .
D: i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .
D: good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
P: hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
D: mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
P: uh , not that i recall .
[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .
D: good , i'm glad to hear that .
D: before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .
D: that's impressive , mr . watson .
P: yeah , i guess .
[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .
D: no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?
[patient_guest] no , not at all .
D: and how about cognition ?
P: i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said "" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , ""
D: that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
P: no . has n't bothered me one bit .
D: okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?
P: ca n't say that i have .
D: okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?
P: sounds good .
D: okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
D: all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
P: so what does that mean ?
D: just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
P: all right so i'll come back in three months ?
D: yep , that's right .
P: i do have a question for you though .
D: yeah , of course .
P: do you think i will be able to drive again ?
D: ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
D: now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
P: okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
D: yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
P: i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
D: yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?
P: thanks
[patient_guest] thank you .
D: all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions . negative for fever or unintentional weight loss . gu is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper . negative for genital sores , decreased or painful output . neurological significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment . negative for headaches , recent falls , or hallucinations . psychiatric is negative for depression , excessive worrying , or mood swings .
D: let's go ahead and use the short pe . vitals , let's see , blood pressure is 124/80 , heart rate 64 , respirations 18 , weight 174 pounds , and pain zero out of 10 .
D: mr . watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily through , um , though his daughter does add some details . the shunt sight was clean , dry , and intact with a confirmed setting of two . um he was tested um for recent and remote memory , attention span , and concentration in fund of knowledge . he scored a 26 out of 30 on the mmse when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations . of note , he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing , and the third with multiple choice . this was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling . and at the time he was unable um in the previous test , excuse me , he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing without and only one with multiple choice .
D: gait testing using the tinetti assessment tool . he was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of six to eight out of 12 and a balance score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28 . this is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28 .
D: cranial nerves , pupils are equal . eoms are intact . face symmetric . no disarchria . motor normal for bulk and strength . coordination slow from no- finger to nose . of note , the ct scan from the head of 10/15/2020 shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of monro of 4.6 centimeters with a third ventricular contour that is flat with a span of 10 millimeters . by my reading there is a tiny amount of blood in the right front region with a tiny subdermal collection . this was not noticed or noted by the radiologist who stated any extra axial fluid collections . there is also substantial small vessel ischemic change .
D: diagnosis adult hydrocephalus , gait impairment , urinary incontinence and urgency , and cognitive impairment .

DIALOGUE:
D: amanda taylor , birth date october 31st 1949 . patient is a 72 year old woman who comes for followup for hypertension . her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable .
D: hi miss taylor , how are you today ?
P: hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
D: thanks for coming in today .
P: yeah , no problem .
D: so how have things been going for you ?
P: uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
D: okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
P: on monday .
D: okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
P: yeah , yeah i have .
D: yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
P: yep .
D: how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
P: um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
D: okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
P: yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
D: okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
P: yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
D: okay .
P: i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
D: and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
P: yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
D: okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
P: mm , no .
D: okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
P: yes . yes i am .
D: okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
P: well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
D: okay .
P: but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
D: uh- .
P: mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
D: yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
P: right , mm-hmm .
D: okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
P: okay .
D: use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?
P: no .
D: any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?
P: nope .
D: have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?
P: yes , on february 9th .
D: okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .
P: okay .
D: all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
P: yeah i agree with that .
D: so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
P: the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
D: it actually will help with both .
P: okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
D: generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
P: yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
D: yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
P: yeah , sure , sure .
D: okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
P: i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
D: okay , yeah , maybe you have .
P: yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
D: okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
P: yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?
D: yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .
P: okay .
D: then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .
P: all right that sounds good .
D: all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .
P: all right , sounds good , thank you .
D: you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .
P: you too .
D: miss taylor is drinking alcohol four to five days per week to excess . no tobacco , no substance abuse , skin is moist , good trigger . on exam she is alert , pleasant , in no acute distress . she is not diabetic , there is no tremor , no cva tenderness , chest clear to percussion and auscultation , unlabored breathing , cardiac rhythm regular , no murmur , no gallop , jvp flat , with a head at 90 degrees . she does not appear anxious , agitated or depressed . my impression , alcohol use disorder . she would like to start naltrexone which we have previously discussed . she will take the injectable form and start on may 17th . we reviewed side effects and risks . the potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons . hypertension , she is taking lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams daily . quite possibly her blood pressure will improve completely with cessation of alcohol . her target bp is 130 to 140 over 70 to 80 . i will see her back week of june 14th , which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection . i recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and shingrix . number two , she did defer this .

P: that might help me remember better .

DIALOGUE:
D: tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ?
P: um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
D: that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
P: it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
D: that's it ? and is it still painful ?
P: yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
D: okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
P: i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
D: okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
P: since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
D: okay , but before it was just the knee ?
P: yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
D: okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
P: i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
D: hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
P: well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
D: yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?
P: yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
D: yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?
P: pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
D: okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
P: okay , gotcha .
D: right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
P: yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
D: okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
P: um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
D: so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
P: yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
D: okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
P: yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
D: okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
P: okay , sounds like a plan .
D: all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
P: okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
D: yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
P: i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
D: okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
P: no , i figured i would just come here first .
D: okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
P: all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .
D: yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .
D: fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others . verbal consent was attained . the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications . post-procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .

DIALOGUE:
D: uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
D: hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
P: i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
D: good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
P: yes . it's doing much better .
D: good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
P: yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
D: okay , that sounds good .
P: but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
D: okay .
P: and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
D: i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
P: no , i'm not right now .
D: okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
P: yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
D: okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
P: okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
D: okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
P: okay . i did n't realize that .
D: yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
P: okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
D: so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
P: twice a day .
D: okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
P: no , that's fine .
D: okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
P: yes .
D: how often are you using that one ?
P: after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
D: okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
P: no .
D: so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
P: i'm not .
D: okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
P: no wipes .
D: okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
P: i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
D: no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
P: okay .
D: um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
P: that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
D: okay .
P: and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
D: okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
P: yeah .
D: i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
P: okay .
D: uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
P: okay , i can do that .
D: i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
P: it is ? okay .
D: um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
P: yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
D: great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
P: yes , i did . thank you .
D: all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
P: yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
D: it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
P: okay .
D: let's see .
P: so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
D: ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
P: i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
D: yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
P: okay .
D: because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
P: yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
D: okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
P: you mean the tacrolimus ?
D: yeah , mm-hmm .
P: okay .
D: so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
P: can you do the metro market ?
D: yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
P: sure .
D: pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
P: okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
D: correct , it's not a steroid .
P: okay , good .
D: it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
P: okay .
D: but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
P: all right .
D: these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
P: okay . got it .
D: so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
P: okay , thank you for explaining .
D: so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
P: okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
D: yes , and keep using the face wash.
P: okay .
D: i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
P: i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
D: i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
P: all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
D: i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
P: that sounds good .
D: so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
P: okay .
D: and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
P: okay , sounds good .
D: all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
P: thank you so much .
D: if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
P: okay .
D: but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
P: sounds good .
D: all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
P: okay .
D: once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
P: okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
D: and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
P: all right .
D: i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
P: yeah , sounds good .
D: do you have enough refills ?
P: yeah , i think so .
D: okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
P: yes , i do .
D: all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
P: yes .
D: okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
P: and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?
D: yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .
P: okay , thank you .
D: okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .
P: okay , that sounds good .
D: for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
D: good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
P: yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
D: okay , that sounds good .
P: but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
P: and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
D: i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
P: no , i'm not right now .
D: okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
P: yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
D: okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
D: okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
D: yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
D: so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
P: twice a day .
D: okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
P: no , that's fine .
D: okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
P: yes .
D: how often are you using that one ?
P: after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
D: okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
P: no .
D: so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
P: i'm not .
D: okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
P: no wipes .
D: okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
P: i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
D: no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
D: um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
P: that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
D: okay .
P: and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
D: okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
P: yeah .
D: i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
P: okay .
D: uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
P: okay , i can do that .
D: i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
P: it is ? okay .
D: um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
P: yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
D: great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
D: all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
D: okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
P: you mean the tacrolimus ?
D: yeah , mm-hmm .
P: okay .
D: yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .

DIALOGUE:
D: hey good morning bobby how are you
P: i'm doing okay i as you're aware doctor miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that i've had for several weeks they did he did an ultrasound and and said i had gallstones and they recommended i stay several way from some high fat food but i'm just still having a lot of pain and he referred me to you
D: alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel
P: well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach
D: okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life
P: when it's severe it's it's probably an eight
D: okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you
P: most of the time it comes right after i eat
D: okay
P: but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating
D: okay
P: you know i like to eat right
D: do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit
P: well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes
D: okay
P: and since then i've cut back on sugar and i started a little bit of a keto diet and i've lost about twenty five pounds over the last three months

D: okay
P: but you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better
D: yeah
P: with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs
D: yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake
P: the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain

P: that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since
D: okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs
P: only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy
D: okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way okay and what have you been taking for the pain
P: i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help
D: okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol
P: a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time
D: okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen
P: no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it
D: okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all
P: i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that
D: okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom
P: no i have n't had any of those issues
D: okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any

P: no
D: no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here

P: mm-hmm
D: i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system

DIALOGUE:
D: alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened
P: yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee
D: okay and and how long ago did that happen
P: about three days ago
D: three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that
P: it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down
D: okay
P: but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited
D: okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging
P: it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down
D: okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain
P: anti-inflammatories
D: okay alrighty and did that help
P: yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now
D: gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then
P: i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened
D: okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all
P: i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal
D: gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there
P: a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee
D: yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel
P: just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end
D: okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan

P: but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now
D: okay
P: did n't getting better
D: okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse

D: okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday
P: yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril
D: awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly

D: oof
P: a long time ago and
D: so you know it's good

D: alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage
P: yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
D: mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
P: had some friends tell me something about that
D: yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
P: yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
D: a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
P: yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
D: yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
P: no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
D: yeah
P: checked it in a while so
D: mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
P: well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
D: mm-hmm

P: i see
D: okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no

P: right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know
D: not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain
P: sounds good
D: okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door

DIALOGUE:
P: i hope i did n't hurt it again
D: hi gregory how are you i the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee
P: yeah yeah i heard it stepping off a curb
D: how long ago did that happen
P: about two and a half weeks ago
D: two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you
P: the right knee the outside of my right knee
D: the outside of your right knee
P: yeah
D: okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or
P: no i just sorta turned over my ankle
D: okay
P: to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk
D: and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk
P: no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall
D: okay
P: then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again
D: okay and what have you taken for the pain
P: really nothing
D: okay
P: ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
D: does the ibuprofen work
P: at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
D: does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
P: no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel
D: okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that
P: a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type
D: okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to
P: no i ride the bike
D: okay
P: i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though
D: okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor
P: i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides
D: okay what kind of rides do you like
P: i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with
D: i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
P: yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear
D: okay when did you break your toe
P: i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury
D: okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new
P: right correct
D: alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee
P: no not physically
D: okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt
P: only when you pull it to the outside
D: okay
P: from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts
D: okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home
P: yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it
D: okay
P: i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day
D: okay and so does that help at all
P: it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much
D: okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots
P: and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse
D: okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri
P: okay
D: any questions about that
P: no
D: okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything

DIALOGUE:
D: so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on
P: doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal
D: okay how long has that wound been present
P: maybe about a year
D: a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden
P: no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it
D: okay
P: i went on some antibiotics it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away
D: okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics
P: it's probably been five months
D: five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on
P: keflex
D: keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the
P: no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot
D: alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it
P: lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired
D: okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend
P: not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do
D: no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running
P: yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten
D: okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but
P: yes
D: you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here
P: no
D: okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the
P: yes i think so
D: okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes
P: i've just been wearing my regular shoes
D: okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me
P: i do n't think so
D: alright so i'll see you back in two weeks and i hope you have fun at the zoo this weekend
P: thank you

D: yeah
P: my tries are probably my second favorite food
D: what are you for her toppings on pizza
P: pepperoni occasionally vegetables

P: okay
D: alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound

DIALOGUE:
D: hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on
P: i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay
D: yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
P: yes and and fish oil
D: and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
P: i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
D: you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
P: okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
D: yep
P: how long do i have to have that in there
D: so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
P: okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
D: no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
P: okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack
D: yeah
P: i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to
D: okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies
P: it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty
D: okay
P: fasting
D: okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking
P: i thought it was close to sixty
D: okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet
P: yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results
D: i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
P: oh
D: that's your kidney doctor
P: i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago
D: okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil
P: right yeah that's i threw all of those out
D: okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span
P: i'm a more of a san francisco fan
D: so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again
P: okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches
D: you can take tylenol
P: okay
D: yeah
P: alright that sounds good
D: yeah
P: okay
D: okay
P: this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications
D: yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause
P: yeah i do have that
D: so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay
P: okay
D: okay for your
P: sounds really good
D: good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay
P: okay
D: and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay
P: okay
D: any questions
P: yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad
D: yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others
P: no no i just feel kinda down
D: you feel kinda down what's your
P: life sucks
D: what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like
P: you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely
D: okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out
P: okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time
D: okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay
P: yeah that sounds really good thank you
D: okay you're welcome anything else
P: so you will do the medication refill do i so that's automatic
D: yep i'm gon na put them into the computer and and whatever pharmacy you want yep mm-hmm

DIALOGUE:
D: yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on
P: so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so
D: yeah
P: i think it's been but lately
D: okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what
P: it's gradually increasing for sure
D: okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea
P: nausea and vomiting is on and off
D: hmmm
P: so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week
D: okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times
P: a couple of times
D: okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible
P: yeah
D: that's
P: and the venti
D: yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking
P: yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup
D: okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it
P: it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen
D: hmmm okay
P: so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy
D: okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you
P: no i have n't
D: okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it
P: i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so
D: okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct
P: yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so
D: okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing
P: yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease
D: yep okay
P: i think that's a good decision though
D: yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions
P: that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food
D: hmmm
P: lately that could be contributing towards my gastritis so i'm gon na cut back on that as well
D: okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime

D: okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
P: i was afraid of
D: yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
P: okay
D: we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
P: that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
D: yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
P: no that's great thank you so much
D: thank you very much

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand

D: so elizabeth is a 53 -year-old female today complaining of chest pain and she has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so elizabeth tell me what's going on with your with your chest pain
P: i do n't know every time i start walking i'm just having this kind of pressure and chest pain in my chest
D: okay are you having it now or is it gone right now
P: right now it's not there
D: okay and how long have you been having this
P: probably maybe three months
D: okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it
P: it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain
D: alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it
P: i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure
D: okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place
P: no
D: okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now
P: nothing right now
D: okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going
P: yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose
D: yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you
P: i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting
D: okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin
P: no
D: okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that
P: no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure
D: well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years
P: okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain
D: it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so
P: someone had told me before
D: yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay
P: okay sounds good
D: so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that
P: so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill
D: yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not
P: how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away
D: about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly
P: okay
D: alright
P: mm-hmm
D: and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that
P: no
D: okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
P: okay are there any side effects with this medication
D: yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well
P: okay
D: alright any other questions we got
P: that's it
D: alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today
P: thank you appreciate it

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that.

D: so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness.
D: so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain.
D: and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today.
D: and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well."

D: okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay
P: yeah
D: alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound
P: that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that
D: hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days

P: n- no .
D: okay . all right . well , i know that i've treated you for migraines in the past . how are you doing with those ?

D: so what does all that mean ? you know , you , uh , i'm not quite sure yet but we're gon na review some of your results . hey dragon , show me the chest x-ray .

P: i've been feeling really tired lately . over the past couple of months , i've noticed that my energy has really gone down . i used to be really active , um , just trying to be as healthy as i can be , running, climbing . um , i at least try to do an hour or two a day . and over the past month , it's gone slowly downhill . i've just been so tired and exhausted and i have n't been able to really keep up with the way i , i was g- was going with my exercise .

D: okay .
P: it it just feels like it's burning , um , nothing terribly concerning , not enough to send me to the er , but i do notice it .
D: okay , and where exactly is it located in your chest ?
P: just , um , right in the middle ...
D: okay .
P: right here .
D: okay . and how often are you getting it ?
P: um , probably about three- three times a week .
D: okay , all right . well i'm glad that you talked about that with me today , um , i know the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you , and , you know , you're obviously endorsing this- this chest pressure . um , have you had any other symptoms , i know the- the other ones that you have n't had , but any lower extremity edema , or muscle aches , or fever chills ?
P: no , nothing like that , but i have had a little bit of congestion , um , just from allergies , because of the pollen .
D: okay , so you're endorsing some nasal congestion ?
P: yeah .

DIALOGUE:
D: patient mrn : abc123 . date of birth : january 1st , 1960 . patient is a 60 year old , right-handed male , referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling .
D: hello , mr. cook . how are you doing this morning ?
P: hi , dr. martinez . this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .
D: so it's in both of your hands ?
P: yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .
D: and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ?
P: no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .
D: and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?
P: on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .
D: i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?
P: eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .
D: and when do you feel these symptoms ?
P: well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .
D: okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?
P: like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .
D: and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?
P: yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .
D: and no history of thyroid issues , correct ?
P: nope .
D: all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this .
D: constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative .
P: yep , that's all correct .
D: all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ?
P: yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .
D: sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right .
D: and how about on the left ?
P: um , yeah , but these two a little less .
D: sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
D: okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally .
D: all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ?
P: yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .
D: and how about the left side ?
P: yeah , same on that side too .
D: tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal .
D: all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .
P: okay , so how do we make it better ?
D: first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues .
P: that sounds fine to me .
D: great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .
P: sounds good , doc .
D: all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies .
P: thank you .

D: okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?
P: i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
D: are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
P: sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .
D: okay . what things bother you ?
P: spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
D: we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
P: yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
D: okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?
P: i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .
D: what do you do for work ?
P: i'm a paralegal .
D: okay . and any family history of gi issues ?
P: um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
D: on your mom or dad's side ?
P: mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
D: okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
P: i think maybe when i was younger .
D: but not in the last 10 years ?
P: no .
D: have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
P: um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
D: okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
P: okay .
D: so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
P: i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
D: hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
P: yes .
D: and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
P: okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
D: great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
P: yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
D: so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
P: that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
D: perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
P: okay . can i schedule that today ?
D: yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?
P: that sounds good .
D: perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
D: please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?
P: i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .
D: okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?
P: on the way , it is now i think about a year .

DIALOGUE:
D: . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05/07/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06/29/2021 , and was discharged on 07/02/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ?
P: not too bad . and yourself ?
D: i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
P: yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
D: okay .
P: i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
D: it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
P: it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
D: okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
P: so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
D: typically , it does n't .
P: okay .
D: but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
P: yeah , that's what they said .
D: and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
P: hm .
D: but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
P: yeah .
D: uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
P: yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
D: mm-hmm .
P: it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
D: yeah , it was good that you went in .
P: so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
D: well , maybe that's all it was .
P: yeah .
D: so you're doing good otherwise ?
P: yes , i am .
D: good . let me take a quick listen to you .
P: okay .
D: all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
P: nope .
D: great . so here are my thoughts .
P: okay .
D: you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
P: yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
D: okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
P: mm-hmm .
D: i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
P: okay .
D: and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
P: sure , i can do that .
D: great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
P: okay .
D: and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
P: mm-hmm .
D: i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
P: i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
D: yeah .
P: when i do n't go , i double up on that .
D: have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
P: is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
D: yes .
P: then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
D: got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
P: yeah .
D: all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
P: yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
D: sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
P: i am unvaccinated .
D: so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
P: well , we do n't know the side effects .
D: correct , we do n't .
P: it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
D: right .
P: which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
D: okay .
P: i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
D: well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
P: okay .
D: and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
P: yeah .
D: but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
P: mm-hmm .
D: i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
P: all of them ?
D: yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
P: no , i do n't .
D: right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
P: well , i am open-minded to this .
D: mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
P: okay .
D: so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
P: mm-hmm .
D: the er is full of these vaccines .
P: i understand .
D: so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
P: well , that's what i'm here for .
D: yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
P: okay .
D: so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
P: sure .
D: but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
P: will do .
D: all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
P: nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .
D: you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .
P: thanks , you too .
D: next line heading will be "" acute to chronic constipation "" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis .
D: i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be "" quadriplegia "" . um , next line and heading will be "" covid vaccine status "" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .

DIALOGUE:
D: all right . this is matthew rogers . date of birth 5/24/2007 . i would like to use the acne follow-up template for him . he is here today for an acne follow-up . at the last visit on 3/3/21 he was prescribed the following : clindamycin lotion , uh , trent- tretinoin cream , 4-5 % benzoyl peroxide wash for f-face and 5-10 % for chest and back . so we're going to enter the room :
D: hi there , how are y'all today ?
P: good , how are you ?
D: i'm good , thank you . uh , acne doing better ?
P: yeah .
D: excellence , excellent . tell me , uh , what did you do for your skin this morning ?
P: i washed it with , uh , the benzoyl peroxide and i put the antibiotic thing , and the sunscreen moisture stuff as well .
D: perfect . uh , what did you do last night ?
P: uh , i washed my face with the benzol peroxide , i put , uh , the tret-tret-tretinoin cream , sh-uh sorry i do n't know how to say that , uh , for nighttime and the sunscreen moisture stuff again .
D: all right , all right , now have you had any redness , peeling , dryness , or irritation with the use of these medications at all ?
P: nope . not at all .
D: excellent , excellent . and , uh , washing your chest and back with the higher strength benzoyl peroxide wash , is that right ?
P: uh , no . i did n't get it .
D: okay . um , are your chest and back doing okay ?
P: um , i mean , i have n't put much effort into it because it has n't' really bothered me .
D: fair enough . that's all right . um , if it bothers you , that's what , uh , that's why i recommended last time
P: okay .
D: um , so as we move into the summer it may be something that you are more interested in pursuing doing that , uh , but if you feel like the acne on your face ... do you feel like the acne on your face is improving ?
P: yeah . definitely .
D: all right , good . good . uh , go ahead and bring your mask down . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . that looks good !
P: yeah . it's okay .
D: definitely . uh , this is one of the fun parts of covid for me . it's like the mask comes down for my acne patients and it's like a big reveal . this lo- this looks a lot better , like a lot better . uh , i'm just going to take a look at your back and chest real quick . um , i would n't recommend making any changes to what you're doing . uh , i'm happy with how things are going . are you- are you happy with how things are going ?
P: yeah .
D: all right , yeah . if that little bit bothers you , i would use a 5-10 % benzoyl peroxide base . i think that ... i think that what i have using on your face is a 4-5 % . um , usually the back and chest can handle a little , uh , a little something stronger . um , that's the only thing i would think about changing , otherwise it think this looks great .
P: sounds good .
D: all right , uh , do you have any questions for me ?
P: um , i do n't . i'm just going to write that down .
D: uh , well you want me to write that down for you on your , uh , checkout sheet ?
P: uh , yeah . that'd be awesome .
D: uh , the one i recommend for the chest and back is the , the PanOxyl 10 % . uh , we actually have samples of it and coupons . so i can send you home with those .
P: cool . that'd be perfect .
D: all right , um , so i'm going ahead and tee up a one year prescription for you because at this point i'll want to see you once a year . i want to make sure that you have enough of your medicines , um , and these are going to walgreens on broad ?
P: uh , yeah .
D: okay . um , all right . so the tretinoin , uh , usually lasts patients a couple of months . you probably have n't refilled that , right ?
P: uh , yeah , we did once , i think .

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: all right, all right, now have you had any redness, peeling, dryness, or irritation with the use of these medications at all?
P: nope. not at all.
D: excellent, excellent. and, uh, washing your chest and back with the higher strength benzoyl peroxide wash, is that right?
P: uh, no. i didn't get it.
D: okay. um, are your chest and back doing okay?
P: um, i mean, i haven't put much effort into it because it hasn't really bothered me.
D: definitely. uh, this is one of the fun parts of covid for me. it's like the mask comes down for my acne patients and it's like a big reveal. this lo- this looks a lot better, like a lot better. uh, i'm just going to take a look at your back and chest real quick. um, i wouldn't recommend making any changes to what you're doing. uh, i'm happy with how things are going. are you- are you happy with how things are going?
P: yeah.
D: all right, yeah. if that little bit bothers you, i would use a 5-10 % benzoyl peroxide base. i think that ... i think that what i have using on your face is a 4-5 %. um, usually the back and chest can handle a little, uh, a little something stronger. um, that's the only thing i would think about changing, otherwise it think this looks great.
P: sounds good.

DIALOGUE:
D: okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?
P: i'm doing okay . how are you .
D: i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .
P: yes , that's correct .
D: great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?
P: yeah , that sounds good .
D: okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .
[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .
D: okay .
P: we automatically thought appendix .
D: sure . that makes a lot of sense .
[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .
D: goodness . okay . then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .
D: okay .
[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .
D: wow . okay .
[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .
D: all right-y . then- then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .
D: okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?
[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .
D: okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .
[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .
D: mhm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .
D: all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?
[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .
D: got you . okay .
[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .
D: hmm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .
D: yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?
[patient_guest] only pepcid .
D: okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .
D: all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?
[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .
D: great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?
[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .
D: okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?
[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .
D: okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?
[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .
D: i'm so sorry to hear that .
[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .
D: my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .
[patient_guest] you're welcome .
D: okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?
[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .
D: okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .
[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , "" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . "" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .
D: okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?
[patient_guest] correct . yep .
D: all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .
[patient_guest] yes .
D: okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?
P: i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .
D: okay . and any pain when you go pee ?
P: sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .
D: okay . and any blood in your pee ?
P: no , not that i've noticed .
D: okay .
[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .
D: okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-
[patient_guest] okay .
D: all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .
[patient_guest] okay .
D: all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?
P: okay .
D: good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .
[patient_guest] okay .
D: or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .
[patient_guest] okay . thank you .
D: i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .
D: okay . and does ashley play any sports ?
[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .
D: how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .
[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .
D: okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .
[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .
D: good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .
D: okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .
[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .
D: awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .
[patient_guest] you too .
D: all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?
[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?
D: yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .
P: and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .
D: okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-
P: he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .
D: not because of it . okay .
P: yeah .
D: i see what you're saying .
P: yeah .
D: got it . cool . i'm gon na stop-

P: okay have you broke up with him already or
D: no i did n't know that knee injury was a reason to but now that you've told me maybe we should talk about that
P: we'll talk about that later too
D: okay
P: alright so let's take a let's take a peek at your knee here
D: okay
P: you gon na stick it through the screen or how you're gon na do this alright
D: okay
P: alright then
D: i'm just i'm gon na i'm gon na grab your leg we're just gon na take it through just let it relax i'm just gon na take it through a little range of motion i'm gon na kinda poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay
P: okay okay
D: alright now i'm poking i'm poking i'm poking so on the inside part here
P: is this where it hurts
D: yeah like when you touch it it really hurts
P: right there okay tell me what's worse here or here
D: on the inside
P: okay so medial joint line tenderness
D: mm-hmm
P: pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here
D: no i do n't think so
P: okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side
D: no okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks
P: yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it
D: all the way back
P: okay let's see
D: okay
P: good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too
D: yeah that's fine
P: okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax
D: mm-hmm valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee
P: mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me
D: okay
P: good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right
D: yeah
P: it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts
D: yeah sometimes
P: what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like
D: walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts
P: yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it
D: hmmm
P: you actually no
D: yeah it hurts no
P: what about you i mean are you real weak
D: no i would say i'm pretty strong
P: did you go to the gym
D: i go to the gym but i swim so the
P: okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay
D: yes sir work harder okay
P: do you do you play sports in in college or high school
D: i did in high school
P: yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids
D: no
P: just kinda you're thinking walking the dog
D: yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim
P: on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee
D: no no i have n't would you recommend that
P: well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off
D: okay
P: it's pretty bad
D: okay
P: we'll get we'll get to that too
D: okay
P: so did you already have x-rays of this knee today
D: yes
P: okay do i go into that to
D: yeah
P: look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it
P: you're only cup of this
D: let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like
P: hmmm
D: i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up
P: it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery
D: mm-hmm
P: but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament
D: okay
P: does that make sense
D: yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here
P: okay
D: so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier
P: mm-hmm
D: so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses
P: okay
D: okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner
P: mm-hmm
D: we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first
P: okay
D: it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy
P: okay
D: and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary
P: mm-hmm mm-hmm
D: and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work
P: and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this
D: okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy
P: i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right
D: okay alright i think that sounds good
P: did you get did you select you last night
D: i did
P: you yeah what do you think what do you roof for
D: i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful

P: and the lower numbers seems like it's been okay around seventies
D: seventy okay so a bit high and the hydrochlorothiazide have you been able to take that everyday

D: okay and how about your diet how's been thing as far as salty foods
P: i've been trying to stay away from the salty foods but sugar intake i'm having a little bit of trouble with that
D: okay okay but it seems like you've been making good progress and that could be difficult sometimes and you mentioned being around i think you said your sister a few days ago or a family member
P: yeah she was just kinda sick with similar symptoms and i noticed i started to developed a little bit of a cough right after

P: no
D: no okay so no frontal sinus tenderness how about when i press on the on your cheeks here
P: maybe a little bit just a little bit
D: on both sides
P: yes
D: okay so bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness alright and i'm just gon na take a look at in your mouth if you can open up okay so i do see some do have some erythema of the pharynx and the tonsils are symmetrical i do n't appreciate any exudates now i'm just checking your neck and i do appreciate some anterior cervical adenopathy alright and i'm just gon na take a listen to you alright so listening to your heart so you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and you do still have that two out of six systolic ejection murmur at the left base now i'm taking listen to your lungs and on your lungs exam okay your lungs are nice and clear i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales or rhonchi alright and just looking at your lower extremities i do n't appreciate any edema there so let's talk about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of the cough so looking at your cough it does seem like you have a upper respiratory infection and so basically that's a virus most likely it's a virus that's causing your symptoms especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you so i want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run it's course and taking things just to help with your symptoms so drinking lots of fluids that's gon na help you trying i know you've been doing a cough medicine you can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood pressure and diabetes so you can try like a coricidin hbp can help with the cough and lots of rest okay lots of rest now we are in a current pandemic and so something i can check for you if you're okay with that is checking for covid if that's okay with you

D: no diarrhea okay and then how about as far as your blood pressure
P: blood pressure has been a little bit high i've noticed
D: okay
P: kind of one forties the top number
D: okay
P: and the lower numbers seems like it's been okay around seventies
D: seventy okay so a bit high and the hydrochlorothiazide have you been able to take that everyday
P: yes i've been taking it everyday
D: okay and how about your diet how's been thing as far as salty foods
P: i've been trying to stay away from the salty foods but sugar intake i'm having a little bit of trouble with that
D: okay okay but it seems like you've been making good progress and that could be difficult sometimes and you mentioned being around i think you said your sister a few days ago or a family member
P: yeah she was just kinda sick with similar symptoms and i noticed i started to developed a little bit of a cough right after
D: after that okay
D: okay so let's talk about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of the cough so looking at your cough it does seem like you have a upper respiratory infection and so basically that's a virus most likely it's a virus that's causing your symptoms especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you so i want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run it's course and taking things just to help with your symptoms so drinking lots of fluids that's gon na help you trying i know you've been doing a cough medicine you can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood pressure and diabetes so you can try like a coricidin hbp can help with the cough and lots of rest okay lots of rest now we are in a current pandemic and so something i can check for you if you're okay with that is checking for covid if that's okay with you
P: yes i'm okay with that
D: okay so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that and then we will give you those results okay any questions about that
P: no questions
D: no okay so for problem number two the type two diabetes so we'll continue you on your metformin five hundred milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit so you'll be due at your next visit for your hemoglobin a1c and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells so we do that about every three months so at your next visit we'll check that for you and then we will go from there but it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three your high blood pressure so your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well you're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide so what i would like to do is increase it to twenty five milligrams once a day again i would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then i would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day so we can continue to see how you do with that okay
P: okay alright that sounds"

DIALOGUE:
D: hey betty how're you
P: i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having for a few weeks now
D: wow well i'm sorry to hear that do you remember what you were doing when the pain started
P: i you know i ca n't think about anything specifically but i am very active and i also have been renovating my basement so i have been doing a lot with that
D: wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything
P: no no trauma that i can think of at all
D: okay
P: i do n't remember hitting it either
D: okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
P: you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of
D: okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder
P: it is
D: okay are you able to move that left arm for me
P: you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts
D: okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go
P: it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there
D: okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all
P: i ca n't
D: alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side
P: i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up
D: okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain
P: yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours
D: okay
P: and it does help take the edge off
D: okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level
P: without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three
D: okay and then with tylenol with that
P: i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three
D: okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing
P: yeah
D: so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift
P: yeah it just time we've been living in this house for some time now and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work
D: nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here
P: no
D: yeah it's nice my wife and i were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at home depot
P: i definitely will check that out
D: so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand
P: no
D: okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan
P: yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away
D: i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do

P: yes
D: okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still
P: most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day
D: yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right
P: correct
D: okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound

P: so i i had a doc gave me some injections before i'm not sure what they were though
D: okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective
P: no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it
D: okay but did the did the exercises help
P: i mean i guess a little
D: okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications
P: yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was
D: okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now
P: i mean i sit at home all day
D: okay
P: watch tv
D: okay
P: so not very active i've gained about eighty pounds the past year
D: okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions
P: i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis
D: okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad
P: i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though
D: okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking
P: what type of smoking
D: any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but
P: okay
D: have you smoked
P: next maybe that i have n't
D: are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before
P: okay i smoked
D: okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it
P: i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked
D: okay you have
P: too many questions are you the fit
D: i'm your doctor i have to
P: are you the fence you sound like the fence next question
D: i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking
P: no
D: okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things
P: sent them off yeah
D: pardon
P: because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
D: you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
P: yeah it hurts
D: okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
P: a little bit
D: okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
P: stop
D: okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
P: what does that mean like am i dying
D: no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
P: that's a big word
D: those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
P: i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
D: we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
P: okay
D: alright
P: can i get pain pills too
D: can you
P: for pain
D: can you get what now
P: pain pills
D: so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
P: i'd say it was n't effective
D: okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
P: yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
D: okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
P: i do n't want i know
D: right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
P: mm-hmm
D: do you have any questions
P: no
D: alright
P: when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
D: okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions
P: no
D: okay thank you

DIALOGUE:
D: good afternoon matthew how are you
P: i'm okay
D: it looks like here that the that you've been brought in for some vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today
P: yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place
D: mm-hmm
P: i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment
D: okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on
P: well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me
D: okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street
P: my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was
D: it was
P: it was just phenomenal
D: it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's
P: mm-hmm
D: but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon
P: yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for
D: i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day
P: yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped
D: yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis
P: i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it
D: okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me
P: okay that's a bright light
D: yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection
P: have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye
D: well
P: what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye
D: yeah literally yeah
P: yeah
D: the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection
P: no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good
D: okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process
P: okay
D: alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today
P: okay okay
D: sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes
P: okay thank you very much
D: thank you

A/P DIALOGUE:","D: okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me
P: okay that's a bright light
D: yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection"

D: okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt
P: no no no pain
D: alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in
P: yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender
D: okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you
