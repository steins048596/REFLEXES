An MRI was obtained on 4/24/2021 showing focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. The patient has been under the care of physical therapy staff and a PA. He reports continued pain and inability to make a fist since the accident and has expressed dissatisfaction with his current medical care.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n\nBlood pressure medication.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\nReaction to dexamethasone (causes heart to race), itching with methylprednisolone.\n\nEXAM:\n\nExamination of the right index finger shows a 10-degree PIP-flexed position, slight discomfort with correction, and tenderness.

The patient describes waking up at around two o'clock in the morning with significant pain. Application of ice has helped to ease the pain. On several nights, the pain has persisted and has affected his sleep. The pain starts in the hand and goes down the entire arm. He has also noticed some weakness in his hand, particularly in gripping objects, and mentions a previous injury to a finger. He has been treated with numbing medicine, a neck pill, and gabapentin, which has provided some relief. The patient also states that he is one percent disabled from leg issues (neuropathy) related to his knees down to his feet. An initial assessment by another physician suggested the pain was most likely due to a pinched nerve.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nNeurological: Reports weakness in the hand, especially in gripping things.

Upper and lower extremities examination was unremarkable. Musculoskeletal examination revealed non-tenderness over the cervical spine and mildly restricted cervical.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAn X-ray of the neck showed a lot of arthritis and potential for a disc pushing on a nerve. No MRI of the neck available, but one was recommended.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLikely cervical radiculopathy causing left arm pain, with associated arthritis of the cervical spine.\n\nPLAN\n\nThe patient and I have decided to proceed with an MRI of the neck to visualize exactly where the nerve roots may be compressed, potentially causing the hand issue. An epidural is tentatively planned as a focused anti-inflammatory treatment, pending MRI results.\n\nThe patient is to continue taking gabapentin as prescribed, and I have advised him to maintain his current medication regimen including Eliquis. I will order the imaging study, and Roy will assist with scheduling the MRI and the epidural.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me after the MRI and epidural to assess improvement.

The patient has been experiencing this eye twitch for a couple of weeks, as reported by her father. It occurs several times an hour on some days, while other days it is not observed until the late afternoon. Karen reports feeling an urge to move her face before it twitches and experiences relief once the twitch occurs. There is no pain associated with the twitch. The twitch has not affected her daily activities, including her playtime and her participation in soccer. No other symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, or headache have been reported. \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nKaren enjoys playing soccer every Saturday and has a regular outing with her father which often includes a meal at McDonald's. She expresses interest in shopping for dresses and toys. \n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nKaren is not currently on any medication.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nNeurologic: Reports right eye twitch with no associated pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nThe neurological exam reveals the patient to be awake, alert, and oriented times three. Speech is clear and fluent. Gait is steady. Heel-toe walking is normal. The cranial nerves are intact with no focal neurologic findings. There is no pronator drift. Sensation is intact. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right eye twitch - Suspected Tic Disorder.\n\nPLAN\n\nGiven the patient's age, reported symptoms, and physical examination, it is believed that Karen has a tic disorder, which is common in children around her age. Since it does not seem to be impacting her daily activities, the best course of action currently is observation and reassurance. We should avoid drawing attention to the tic, as this can potentially worsen it. If the condition worsens, re-evaluation and possible treatment will be considered. No medications are prescribed at this time. It is recommended to have regular follow-ups to monitor the patient's condition.",

The pain has been intermittent but became more severe over the last week when the patient attended a trade show convention and had difficulty walking. The pain is described as throbbing and occasionally sharp, especially when moving or walking for extended periods. Light pressure, such as sheets touching the toe at night, exacerbates the pain. The patient reported a sensation of heat in the area, but no particular injury or event preceding these symptoms. He has been taking ibuprofen without significant relief.\n\nThe patient enjoys riding bikes, and pain doesn't seem to affect this activity as he pedals using the back of his feet.

The pain was more pronounced on the outside of the big toe. Upon palpation, a bone spur was felt, and the patient reported a sensation of grinding when the toe was pushed back.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays obtained and reviewed today revealed a large spur on the top of the big toe joint and loss of much of the cartilage, indicating arthritis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Big toe pain and redness.\n2. Arthritis in the big toe (Hallux Rigidus).\n\nPLAN\n\nGiven the presence of a large spur and loss of cartilage as seen on the X-ray, the patient was diagnosed with hallux rigidus. The treatment plan is to start with an orthotic insert for the shoe and an anti-inflammatory medication, meloxicam, once daily. The patient has no history of stomach problems and was warned to contact the doctor if he develops symptoms such as heartburn or pain in the sternum due to potential stomach irritation caused by meloxicam.\n\nThe patient is to continue with his regular activities and work to test the effectiveness of the treatment plan.

This has been ongoing for approximately four days and has not improved. He also endorses occasional tingling in his leg dependent on certain positions. There is no loss of bowel or bladder function, and no history of back surgeries or major back problems. He has taken ibuprofen, which provided some relief.\n\nRegarding his diabetes type 2, Mr. Thompson monitors his blood sugar 2-3 times a week and reports that it is generally within the 120-140 range. He acknowledges that his diet could be improved. He is currently on metformin 500 mg twice a day. \n\nHe is also being managed for hypertension, for which he is currently on Norvasc 5 mg once a day. His blood pressure readings at home have been in the range of 120-130 over 70-80.
