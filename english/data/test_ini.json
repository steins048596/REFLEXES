Shortness of Breath and Fatigue: These symptoms could be due to severe aortic stenosis. We will continue to monitor her symptoms.3. Leg Pain: We will continue to manage her severe leg pain with the current regimen of pain medications. She should also discuss the possibility of discontinuing simvastatin with her primary care physician as it could potentially be contributing to her leg pain.4.

He states that the pain began after engaging in a variety of outdoor projects in his backyard, including laying down stone, extending his patio, and building flower boxes. His right shoulder started to feel sore, and unlike the general soreness he had from the yard work, this particular pain persisted. He reports having minor issues with this shoulder in the past due to an old baseball injury, as it is his dominant side. The patient reports that the pain is localized on the outer side of the right shoulder, particularly when he lifts his arm. The pain is not constant, but primarily noticed during movement and mildly when sleeping as he usually sleeps on this side. He denies any numbness or tingling in his right arm or hand. For pain management, he has been taking Advil and applying ice, which provides some relief. He does not report any attempts at physical therapy. ",

Currently, her pain is most severe on the lateral aspect of her right knee, and she reports a feeling of instability, with her knee feeling as though it might 'buckle'. The patient has found that she is no longer able to bend her knee as easily as immediately post-injury, and straightening it causes significant pain. The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her toes and has full sensation. The patient has been using crutches provided by the ski patrol.The patient describes herself as an active individual, engaging in skiing and running regularly, as well as chasing after her twin four-year-old children. The patient's husband is able to assist her, although his work often requires him to be away from home.",

The patient has been experiencing intermittent right-sided flank pain radiating to his groin for the past two weeks. He describes the pain as variable, depending on his hydration status and activity level. He rates it as typically 1-2/10, but with episodes escalating to 4/10. There is no pain upon urination, and no hematuria observed. The patient had an episode where pain radiated to one of his testicles, but this symptom has since subsided. He has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen for pain, with partial relief. He denies any accompanying nausea or vomiting but did experience some chills without fever.
