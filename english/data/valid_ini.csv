EXAMPLE NOTE:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Fisher is a 59-year-old male who presents for routine follow up of his chronic problems.

Mr. Fisher reports that he has been managing his depression. He is on Prozac 20 mg daily and was taking it regularly, but weaned himself off of it and felt a little better. He is currently taking less of a dose and does not feel the side effects as much, but he is willing to try something different. His asthma has been acting up because of the bad pollen season and has been using his inhaler when it seems to go over 85 degrees. He does not use it if it is cold outside. He is keeping his diabetes under control. The patient 's diet has been good for the most part, but has been traveling all over for his children's sports tournaments and did not stick to his diet and notes over the weekend eating pizza.

The patient endorses lightheadedness and dizziness when running up and down the stairs. He attributes this to heat and fatigue. He denies chest pain and abdominal pain. Endorses shortness of breath..

Mr. Fisher also endorses knee pain from running up and down stairs, but nothing out of the ordinary.

The patient exercises in the morning and rides a bike for 45 minutes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Joseph Fisher is a 59-year-old male who presents for routine follow up of his chronic problems.

Asthma.
• Medical Reasoning: His symptoms are exacerbated during warmer weather, but his recent pulmonary function tests were normal.

Right upper arm pain.

HPI:

Ms. Russell is a 39-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of severe right upper arm pain. She states she was playing volleyball yesterday and fell and landed on her arm. She has been taking ibuprofen every 6 hours but it does not help. She rates her pain 9/10. She denies any numbness or tingling in her arm. She has a history of gallstones and takes Pepcid. She has a past surgical history of a lumbar fusion 6 years ago. She denies any allergies.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right humerus, 2 views, obtained on today's visit show a proximal humerus fracture.

IMPRESSION

Right proximal humerus fracture.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended we place her into a long arm cast and sling. She will follow up in 2 weeks for repeat imaging. At that point, we may need to discuss surigical options. I will prescribe Lortab, 5 mg, #20 (twenty) to take every 6 hours as needed for pain.

[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?

[doctor] all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?
[patient] right on the inside of my knee . right here .
[doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?

[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?

On examination, her right knee is tender over the medial aspect, particularly over the area of the medial meniscus. Pain is elicited upon flexion and valgus stressing of the knee. No additional pain or tenderness is reported in the calf area. Sensation is preserved in the distal extremities.

RESULTS:

X-rays of the right knee obtained during today's visit show no fractures or dislocation. There is a minor amount of fluid, but all components seem to be aligned properly.

IMPRESSION:

Acute strain or sprain of the medial meniscus of the right knee.

PLAN:

Discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with Ms. Thompson. Recommended a knee brace and the use of crutches temporarily for the next few days. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in one week to reassess her condition. If her symptoms are not improving at that time, we will order an MRI. I prescribed Motrin, 800 mg, to be taken every six hours with food. A two-week supply was provided. 

All questions were answered, and Ms. Thompson is to follow the plan as discussed. The prescriptions and procedures have been ordered and the report has been finalized."

By Monday morning it loosened up a little bit, but it is still pretty sore. He had some right lower extremity weakness and some drop foot that he felt that for a while, and it got a little better this morning but not much. He had surgery about 10 years ago in his lower back.

Regarding his congestive heart failure, he has been watching his diet and trying to exercise regularly. He is avoiding the salty foods and has been compliant with medications. He has gained a little weight over the summer but nothing more than 5 pounds. He has no problems lying flat to go to bed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Logan is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. He presents today with lower back pain that started on Saturday morning after lifting heavy boxes. He reports hearing a 'pop' sound and subsequently experienced intense pain which compelled him to lie down for an hour. The pain then became somewhat stiff, and he also reports experiencing transient tingling in the toes of his right foot, which resolved on Sunday afternoon. He has been attempting to manage the pain with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, and Icy Hot, with little success.

Regarding his diabetes, he reports a recent diet slip due to helping his daughter move, which involved on-the-go meals. He also acknowledges a preference for peanut butter cups. He's cognizant of needing a dietary reset. 

With respect to his hypertension, he reports that he usually monitors his blood pressure during the weekdays but tends to forget on weekends. He asserts his blood pressure has been mostly under control and confirms compliance with his medication.

Concerning his osteoarthritis, it occasionally flares up, especially after running or lifting heavy items.

[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .

She recently attempted to donate blood in December and was informed that she was anemic. This was not the first time she had been diagnosed with anemia, which has been an ongoing issue since she was 13. 

Ms. Cooper has been experiencing fatigue, chills, breathlessness, wheezing, headaches, and heightened anxiety and depression. She has a history of heavy periods until her hysterectomy in 1996. She had a normal colonoscopy five to six years ago and doesn't have any known history of sleep apnea, pacemaker use, or use of oxygen at night. She drinks alcohol only once or twice a year.

She has recently started taking 25 mg of ferrous sulfate twice daily and over-the-counter vitamin B12. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Endorses fatigue and chills.
• Cardiovascular: Endorses breathlessness and wheezing.
• Neurological: Endorses headaches.
• Psychiatric: Endorses increased anxiety and depression.
• Gastrointestinal: No recent history of GI bleeds.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds.
• Pulmonary: Breath sounds normal.
• Abdomen: Soft, non-tender with no organomegaly.

RESULTS

Recent blood work revealed low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs with low ferritin.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Christina Cooper is a 69-year-old female with a long-standing history of iron deficiency anemia. 

Iron deficiency anemia.
• Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of heavy periods until her hysterectomy, history of anemia since her teenage years, and low ferritin on recent labs, her anemia is likely due to iron deficiency. 
• Medical Treatment: She has been asked to continue ferrous sulfate 25mg twice daily along with vitamin B12. To enhance iron absorption, she has been advised to take the iron pills with orange juice.
• Additional Testing: A recheck of CBC, iron, ferritin, B12, and folate will be conducted after 12 weeks.
• Specialist Referrals: An upper endoscopy and colonoscopy have been planned to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If the results are inconclusive, a capsule endoscopy will be considered. A referral has also been sent to a hematologist to assess whether intravenous iron or other treatments to help her body store iron better are necessary.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan. She will schedule her upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, and appointment with the hematologist. She will follow the bowel prep instructions and will reach out with any questions or worsening symptoms."

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.

DIALOGUE: [doctor] patient , bruce ward . date of birth 5/21/1969 . please use my neuro consult template . this is a 52-year-old male with dia- newly diagnosed pituitary lesion . the patient is seen in consultation at the request of dr. henry howard for possible surgical intervention . mr . ward presented to his primary care provider , dr. howard , on 3/1/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months . he denied any trouble with headaches in the past . his past clinical history is unremarkable .
[doctor] worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted .
[doctor] hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores .
[patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you .
[doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ?
[patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .
[doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ?
[patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .
[doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ?
[patient] well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ? specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ?
[patient] no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no- no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling . and i've never passed out in my life . but , um , for some reason recently i seem to be bumping into door frames .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ?
[patient] no i do n't think so . my eyes were checked in the fall .
[doctor] okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ?
[patient] no i do n't have any medical problems and i do n't take any medicines . i tried tylenol a few times for the headaches but it did n't work , so i stopped .
[doctor] i see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ?
[patient] i was adopted so i really have no idea .
[doctor] okay . um , what kind of work do you do ? and are you married ?
[patient] i work as a computer programmer and i've been married for 25 years . we just bought a small house .
[doctor] that's nice . um , do you drink any alcohol , smoke , or use recreational drugs ?
[patient] nope . i do n't do any of those and never have .
[doctor] okay . um , well let me take a good look at you . um , now you'll hear me calling out some details as i perform the examination . these will be noted for me in your record and i'll be happy to answer any questions you have once we're done .
[patient] sounds good , doc .
[doctor] all right . the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal , motor , or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . and color vision is normal .
[doctor] all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames .
[patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .
[doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery .
[patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?
[doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death .
[patient] well i guess we have to do it regardless .
[doctor] okay . so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah , on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly so i do n't want you to be alarmed . um , she'll also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery . but we have the pre-surgery visual field test for comparison after surgery .
[patient] okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on .
[doctor] yeah . come this way , we'll get your things lined up . please call if you think of any questions .
[patient] thanks , doctor .
[doctor] diagnosis will be pituitary adenoma . mr . ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has benign appearing pituitary adenoma , incidentally discovered during workup for worsening headaches . he is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression , therefor surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated . end of note .

        ","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Headaches and a newly discovered pituitary lesion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bruce Ward, a 52-year-old male, presents for a neurosurgical consultation due to a pituitary lesion discovered during a workup for chronic headaches. The patient first reported these worsening headaches to his primary care provider, Dr. Henry Howard, on 03/01/2023. The headaches were new for the patient and described as located behind the eyes, with a dull, nagging quality, worsening over the past three months. Initially, the pain severity was 3 out of 10, which has now escalated to a 6 out of 10. The headaches typically present in the morning, lasting for a few hours, with no identifiable triggers or alleviating factors. The patient denies any additional symptoms, including nausea, fever, rashes, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or syncope. However, he did mention recent incidents of bumping into door frames.

On further evaluation, a brain MRI revealed a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The patient's complete blood count, urea, coagulation, and C-reactive protein results were normal. However, his pituitary hormone profile showed a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level.

PAST HISTORY

The patient has no known chronic illnesses, takes no medications, and has no known familial history of disease due to his adoption.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works as a computer programmer, is married for 25 years, and recently purchased a house. He denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substance use.

EXAMINATION

The patient was alert, oriented, and had fluent speech. The cranial nerve examination was grossly intact with no focal, motor, or sensory deficits observed in the upper or lower extremities. Visual acuity and eye movements were normal, pupils were equal and reactive, but visual field testing revealed bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision was reported as normal.

DIAGNOSIS

Pituitary adenoma.

ASSESSMENT

Mr. Ward's condition presents as a benign appearing pituitary adenoma. The patient is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression due to the pituitary lesion. 

PLAN

Given the symptoms and the findings from the MRI, surgical intervention is recommended for excision and decompression of the pituitary fossa. The patient was informed about the transsphenoidal surgical approach and associated risks, including anesthesia, infection, need for further surgery, wound complications, seizures, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, and possible death. A pre-surgery visual field test was also planned for mapping peripheral vision, enabling post-surgery comparison and monitoring. The patient was referred to the surgery scheduler and to an ophthalmologist for a detailed eye examination. 

Mr. Ward understands the need for surgery and is scheduled to meet with the surgery scheduler to plan the procedure. The patient will be encouraged to contact the clinic if he has further questions or concerns. End of note."

EXAMPLE NOTE:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Roger Nelson is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up for chest pain. The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and a full chest pain for approximately hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.

The patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.

His blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Neck
• General Examination: I do feel a little large thyroid that is not tender. She has a carotid bruit on the right side. 

Respiratory
• Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. Cardiovascular
• Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, but I do hear 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Gastrointestinal
• Examination of Abdomen: Soft. There is a healed scar on the right knee from prior knee surgery. Musculoskeletal
• Examination: There is no lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Blood pressure is elevated.

EKG is normal.

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up. He presented to the emergency room for chest pain and elevated blood pressure of 180/95. His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.

Chest pain and hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.
• Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

DIALOGUE: [doctor] next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ?
[patient] good morning . yes . that's me .
[doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you too .
[doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ?
[patient] well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then .
[doctor] okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ?
[patient] um , early october .
[doctor] of 2020 , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?
[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .
[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?
[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .
[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?
[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .
[doctor] okay . i see .
[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .
[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?
[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .
[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?
[patient] yes . with eating .
[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?
[patient] mm-hmm . i did .
[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?
[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .
[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .
[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .
[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?
[patient] they're normal .
[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?
[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .
[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?
[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .
[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?
[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .
[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?
[patient] i'd say it's about the same .
[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .
[patient] okay . good .
[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .
[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .
[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?
[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .
[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .
[patient] no . that's it . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .
CLINICAL NOTE:
        ","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Hill, a 55-year-old female, presents with a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia. She was referred by the ER due to suspected esophagitis following an episode of chest pain in October of 2020. She experienced this chest pain for four days, which then subsided without intervention. The pain was centered behind her breastbone, sharp in nature, and exacerbated with eating. She also reported difficulty swallowing during this period. The patient had a negative workup in the ER including normal EKG and blood tests. She denies recurrent symptoms since that time. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Abdominal Examination: Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants. No pain or tenderness in lower belly. No other abnormalities were noted.

RESULTS

Normal cardiac workup from ER records.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 55-year-old female who presents with a history of a short-lived episode of chest pain and dysphagia, presumed to be esophagitis per ER evaluation, though currently asymptomatic. Multiple potential etiologies have been considered including GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal causes, and anxiety, given her stressful job transition during the same period.

Medical Reasoning: Given the transient nature of her symptoms, as well as her lack of ongoing discomfort, it is possible that the patient experienced an anxiety-related episode in conjunction with some GI involvement, possibly esophagitis. 

Medical Plan: It was suggested that an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) could be conducted to evaluate her esophagus and stomach, however, considering the patient has been asymptomatic for three months, and esophagitis would likely be healed by now, it may not provide additional diagnostic value. The patient agreed to self-monitor her symptoms and contact the clinic with any recurrence or change in symptoms. Regular follow-ups as needed were also recommended.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the proposed plan to monitor her symptoms and reach out in case of recurrence. She agreed to delay the EGD unless her symptoms reoccur or change."

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Abnormal labs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Stephanie Diaz is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, kidney stones, and prior colonoscopy, who presents today for abnormal labs.

The patient reports she has been really tired and dizzy over the past couple of months. She reports these symptoms while walking a mile, going to work, and performing daily tasks. She denies any blood in her stools recently but notes she had blood in her stool about 3 years ago and had a colonoscopy for that. She denies any black, tarry stools, heavy menstrual bleeding, unintentional weight loss, or syncope.

Ms. Diaz had a colonoscopy about 3 years ago due to blood in her stool. This showed mild diverticulitis. She denies issues since that time.

Regarding her congestive heart failure, she states she is not doing well with her salt intake. This has been more of a struggle recently as she has been traveling a lot. She has noticed some swelling in her legs but nothing too extreme.

The patient denies recent issues with kidney stones. She denies low back pain, flank pain, or blood in her urine.

Ms. Diaz notes she has had some nasal congestion but attributes this to the season changing. She gets seasonal allergies but everything else has been okay. The patient denies fever, chills, sore throat, or cough.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss. Endorses fatigue.
• Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from allergies.
• Cardiovascular: Denies dyspnea.
• Respiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematochezia, melena.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral leg swelling.
• Neurological: Endorses dizziness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
• Musculoskeletal: Trace to 1+ edema in the bilateral ankles.

RESULTS

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction of 45%. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

Hemoglobin is 8.2.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Stephanie Diaz is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, kidney stones, and prior colonoscopy, who presents today for abnormal labs.

Anemia.
• Medical Reasoning: This is a new issue. Her recent hemoglobin level was low at 8.2, but she denies any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or urinary tract bleeding, as well as any abnormal menstrual bleeding. Her colonoscopy from 3 years ago demonstrated mild diverticulosis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an anemia profile for further evaluation.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer her back to gastroenterology for repeat evaluation with possible endoscopy and colonoscopy.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She has noticed some lower extremity edema. Her echocardiogram from 6 months ago demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as moderate mitral regurgitation.
• Medical Treatment: We will initiate Lasix 40 mg once daily, and continue with Toprol 50 mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She should continue to limit her sodium intake. I advised her to monitor her daily weights and notify me if these start to increase.

Kidney stones.
• Medical Reasoning: She as asymptomatic denies any recent flare ups.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications and proper hydration. She will contact me with any questions or concerns.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Pediatric assessment for a rare genetic syndrome.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Katherine is a 22-month-old girl, the twin sibling of a 9-year-old boy with autism, presenting today for an assessment related to her diagnosis of Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS). She is under the care of multiple specialists including a gastroenterologist, dietitian, allergist, neurologist, orthopedist, and ophthalmologist. 

The patient's mother states that Katherine was born premature with a birth weight of 4 pounds 8 ounces, compared to her twin who weighed 3 pounds 13 ounces. She reports that Katherine had difficulties feeding and maintaining her body temperature at birth. Currently, Katherine is starting to crawl and take steps, which indicates developmental progress. She is involved in feeding, occupational, and physical therapy and will soon start speech therapy.

Katherine has been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux, which is managed with dietary changes including removing cow's milk from her diet. According to her mother, Katherine drinks a lot, mostly pea protein milk, water, and diluted juice. She produces approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers per day.

The patient's mother is particularly concerned about potential kidney issues associated with SMS, as mentioned by their geneticist. They are visiting today to ensure that Katherine's kidneys are functioning well.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• General: Well-nourished female, slightly fussy during the exam. No noted fevers, chills, or weight loss.
• Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: No abnormalities reported.
• Cardiovascular: No dyspnea reported.
• Respiratory: No cough, shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Mother reports issues with feeding and reflux.
• Musculoskeletal: Mild hypotonia of the lower extremities.
• Neurological: Developmental delay observed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• General: Katherine appears well-nourished.
• Eyes: Small appearing.
• Musculoskeletal: Mild hypotonia observed in the lower extremities.
• Genitourinary: Normal external female genitalia.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Katherine, a 22-month-old former 34 and 3-week-old twin with Smith-Magenis Syndrome. The patient's mother is concerned about the potential kidney abnormalities associated with the syndrome. 

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract have been reported in association with this chromosomal deletion syndrome, so a screening of the kidneys by ultrasound will be obtained today. 

The next steps and future follow-ups will be determined based on the ultrasound results. The family resides in Dallas, Georgia, so future appointments will be at the town center location if necessary.

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Diaz is a pleasant 31-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right ankle pain. The onset of her pain began when she slipped on a patch of ice while taking out the trash. She states that she heard a pop at the time of the injury. The patient reports that she was unable to ambulate on her right ankle initially after the injury; however, she is now able to bear some weight on her right ankle, but she is still limping. The patient rates her pain level as a 6 out of 10. Ms. Diaz describes her pain as constant and throbbing. She reports that her right ankle is warm to the touch. She denies any numbness or tingling in her right foot. The patient has been icing and elevating her right ankle while also utilizing ibuprofen last night and this morning, which did not provide her with any relief. The patient states that she used to play a lot of soccer in high school so she notes that she has had other right foot injuries but not like this.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Positive right ankle pain.
Skin: Positive warmth to the right foot.
Neurological: Denies any numbness or tingling.

VITALS

BP: 120/80
SPO2: 98%.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Normal sensation. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle reveals ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with swelling. Tenderness to palpation anterolaterally in the soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer or inversion stress. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right ankle taken in office today reveals no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Right ankle sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have advised her to keep her right leg elevated when she is seated. I have also advised her to ice her right ankle 5 times per day for 20 minutes at a time to help with the swelling. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in an Aircast to stabilize the ankle. She will remain non-weight-bearing for 1 to 2 days, we provided her with crutches today, and then she can begin weight-bearing as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

If her pain does not improve over the next week, she will contact the office and we will obtain an MRI.

[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling
[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling
[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] it does
[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well
[patient] yeah it does
[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like
[patient] not without extreme pain
[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up
[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually
[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright and then lateral as well
[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason
[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist
[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight
[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you
[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all
[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down
[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better
[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] pardon what
[patient] a what
[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace
[patient] okay thank you
[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay
[patient] when do i have to have the surgery
[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so what
[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace
[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks
[patient] six weeks
[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.

The patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.

DIALOGUE: [doctor] hi wayne how're you today
[patient] i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having
[doctor] okay and how long have you had this pain

[patient] honestly i've been trying to recall if i had any specific injury and i ca n't think of that
[doctor] okay
[patient] of anything the only thing i can think of is that i you know i am active and we've just been doing a lot of work in our basement so if i do n't know if i did something while doing that
[doctor] okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[patient] you know i i'm really active and so i i will get some aches and pains here and there but nothing that tylenol ca n't take care of

[doctor] okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go
[patient] the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable
[doctor] okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain
[patient] i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours
[doctor] alright and and did that help
[patient] it does take the edge off but i still have some pain
[doctor] okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you
[patient] yeah i mean it's been fun but yeah i think it really did take a toll on me

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Wayne, a pleasant patient, presents with a complaint of left shoulder pain that started about three weeks ago. He denies any specific injury but has been quite active and has recently been doing a lot of work renovating his basement. He experiences significant pain when reaching, lifting, and attempting any overhead activities. The pain is constant and exacerbated by pressure, such as when lying on the left side at night. He has been taking extra strength Tylenol every six to eight hours which partially alleviates the pain. Wayne reports previous episodes of mild shoulder pain, but those were successfully managed with Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.

VITALS

All vital signs are within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left shoulder showed limited active and passive range of motion. Tenderness was noted over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Hand grip strength was good. Neurovascularly, the left arm is intact distally with a capillary refill of less than three seconds and intact sensation to light touch.

RESULTS

Review of the x-ray of the left shoulder revealed no fractures or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain, likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After discussing with Wayne his current symptoms, physical examination and x-ray results, an MRI of the left shoulder is recommended to further investigate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. Wayne is referred to formal physical therapy for a course of six to eight weeks to strengthen his left shoulder. He will continue taking Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to his left shoulder.

INSTRUCTIONS

Wayne is to follow up with me once the MRI results are available for further discussion and review. He will receive some educational materials about physical therapy and its expectations. He remains positive about the management plan."

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Ross is a pleasant 91-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of her pain began 2 weeks ago, when she was downhill skiing. She states she ran into a tree and twisted her right knee. At the time of the injury, she also heard a pop in her left knee, however she denies left knee pain. The patient locates her pain to the medial aspect of her right knee. Currently, her pain level is 7 out of 10, however she notes this can reach an 11 out of 10 at times with prolonged ambulation. The patient states that her pain has been slowly increasing over the last few days. She experiences limping with ambulation. The patient states that her pain lasts for as long as she is ambulating. She denies radiating pain. She also reports constant swelling and stiffness in the morning. Her stiffness will resolve with ambulation. The patient has been wearing a brace and using THC cream, which has been helpful. She denies taking any medications for pain, however she has been utilizing THC gummies, which have been beneficial.

The patient has a history of a right knee reconstruction when she was 14 years old. She states that she was a good gymnast at that time. The patient adds that she has had problems with her right knee since that time. She denies any other exercises outside of intense gym and ski events. The patient states that she normally skis 3 times per week.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient reports a history of total right knee reconstruction at the age of 14.

MEDICATIONS

She denies needing medications.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, swelling, and stiffness. Denies left knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild effusion. The patient ambulated with an antalgic gait. Pain with dorsiflexion, but not with plantarflexion.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures. There is development of mild arthritis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee posterior cruciate ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.

Regarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.

Intermittent instability of the left knee.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea is a pleasant woman who presents to the clinic today with concerns regarding her left knee. The issue is intermittent in nature, occurring less than once a day, often when she is walking. She describes the sensation as her knee ""giving out"" and sometimes feels as though she might fall, although she is able to catch herself. She has not experienced any particular trauma to the knee or heard any popping sounds. The discomfort is brief, subsiding as quickly as it begins, hence she has not felt the need to take any pain medication. Despite this, she reports needing to use a grocery cart for support while shopping. She has been avoiding activities that may exacerbate her condition, such as line dancing, which she will be unable to participate in during her upcoming trip to a Lion's Club function due to her knee issue.

MEDICATIONS

Andrea is currently on Farxiga, Amlodipine, Lisinopril, Hydrochlorothiazide, and Metformin for her hypertension and diabetes.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee instability - likely related to arthritis.
2. Hypertension - controlled.
3. Diabetes mellitus - mild morning hyperglycemia.

PLAN

I have discussed my assessment and plan with Andrea. For her left knee instability, I have prescribed meloxicam 15 mg daily and recommended physical therapy to strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee and to prevent further instability. For her hypertension, we will continue with her current medication regimen and order an echocardiogram to evaluate her heart murmur. Regarding her diabetes, I have ordered a hemoglobin A1c test to assess her glucose control and will also order a lipid panel. Andrea has been informed and agreed with the plan. She has no further questions at this time. We will schedule her for the echocardiogram and further tests."

X-ray of the chest was reviewed today and shows some round glass opacities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Recurrent lung infections.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms seem consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He is a farmer and has been moving hay quite frequently recently.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed with the patient. I explained that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be caused by bacteria and/or mold that is found in the hay. We discussed that when inhaling this, it leads to an allergic reaction in the lungs, which would explain why symptoms occur every time he moves hay. He was advised that it would be best to eliminate his exposure to hay in order to prevent further damage to his lungs, however, if he is unable to do this then it would be recommended that he wear a respirator when working. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: A course of oral steroids were prescribed today to help decrease his lung inflammation. CT of the lungs will also be ordered today to confirm the diagnosis. A pulmonary function test was also ordered to assess the severity of his respiratory impairment.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[doctor] okay
[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up
[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me
[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections
[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual
[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections
[doctor] diarrhea no
[patient] frequently
[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of
[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies
[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy
[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions
[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes
[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street
[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes
[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that
[doctor] i know i know
[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away
[doctor] right
[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products
[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally
[patient] okay where did you go
[doctor] i was in zambia
[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful
[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time
[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial
[doctor] no
[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you
[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried
[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea
[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and
[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency
[doctor] why is that
[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency
[doctor] okay okay thank you
[patient] you're welcome
[doctor] okay
CLINICAL NOTE:
        ","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Low Immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels and frequent infections.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a business owner, running a family-owned donut shop. Reports recent international travel to Zambia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

Recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and started on Metformin. No other known chronic conditions. 

FAMILY HISTORY

No known family history of immunodeficiencies. Family reported as generally healthy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Reports frequent colds, especially in wintertime. Denies abdominal infections. 

VITALS

Stable vitals as noted by the physician.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

- Auscultation of Lungs: Lungs are clear, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Gastrointestinal
- Abdominal Examination: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no organomegaly noted.

Neck
- Examination: No lymphadenopathy noted.

RESULTS

The lab work reviewed shows low IgA levels, consistent with IgA deficiency. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Low Immunoglobulin A levels.
- Medical Reasoning: The low IgA levels and history of frequent infections suggest an IgA deficiency, which is a common immunodeficiency. However, it appears that the patient may not experience significantly more infections than the average individual. 
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient about his IgA deficiency, its implications, and advised him to watch for persistent infections or severe diarrhea as potential signs of problems related to his deficiency. In case he requires any blood products in the future, he should inform the healthcare provider about his IgA deficiency due to potential reaction risks. 
- Medical Treatment: Further blood work to check other antibodies will be ordered for a more comprehensive understanding of his immune function. The patient was reassured and was open to undergoing the recommended tests. 

2. Type 2 Diabetes.
- The patient is newly diagnosed and recently started on Metformin. He was reminded of the importance of maintaining a balanced diet given his family business.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

MEDICATIONS

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regards to his current symptoms. I want to get an MRI of the bilateral elbows for further evaluation. We discussed the possibility of performing a whole blood transfusion to encourage healing, and the patient is already familiar with this procedure.

DIALOGUE: [doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this elbow pain
[doctor] so it looks like here that you came in to see us today for an evaluation of that right elbow pain can you tell me can you can you tell me well first of all what do you think has been causing that pain
[patient] so i really during this pandemic i really got into ceramics and doing pottery so i've been doing a lot of pottery and over the past week i then started to develop this elbow pain
[doctor] okay and then so tell me a little bit more about that elbow pain where does it hurt exactly
[patient] you know it hurts a lot in the inside of my elbow
[doctor] okay so the inside of your right elbow okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that
[patient] it does n't go into my shoulder it's it stays mostly at my elbow but it can go down a bit into my forearm
[doctor] okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything
[patient] no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything
[doctor] okay and you've never injured that right elbow before
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life
[patient] i would say probably a six
[doctor] okay and does that pain keep you up at night
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities
[patient] yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain
[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[patient] about four days now
[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here
[patient] yes i do
[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that
[patient] not really
[doctor] okay now turn your wrist in so do you have any pain when you do that
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] okay so you do have pain you were positive for pain when you pronate that that that forearm okay i'm gon na go ahead and have you rest your arm on the table here palm side up now i want you to raise your hand by bending at the wrist and i'm gon na put some resistance against it do you have any pain when i press against your flexed wrist
[patient] yes i do
[doctor] alright so you are positive for pain with resistance against flexion of that left wrist so i let let's go ahead and review the x-ray that we did of your elbow the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality of that right elbow which is good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for the problem with elbow pain i do believe that this is consistent with medial epicondylitis which is caused by the overuse and potential damage of those tendons that bend
[doctor] that that bend the wrist towards the palm now i want you to rest it i'm gon na order a sling and i want you to wear the sling while you're awake now we're also gon na have you apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day and i want you to take ibuprofen that's gon na be six hundred milligrams q.6 h. with food and i want you to take that for a full week now you're not gon na like this part but i want you to hold off for the next couple of weeks on doing any type of pottery work okay alright now what i wan na do is i wan na see you again in a week and i wan na see how you're doing okay
[patient] alrighty
[doctor] alrighty so i'll have the nurse come in and get you set up with that sling and i will see you again in about a week

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.

VITALS

Vitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right side.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy.

DIALOGUE: [doctor] hi russell how are you what's been going on
[patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days
[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit
[doctor] okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.

DIALOGUE: [doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that
[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics
[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left
[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now
[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point
[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that
[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc
[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park
[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now
[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there
[patient] i do n't feel that right there
[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure
[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture
[doctor] correct
[patient] if i heard
[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] alright

[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day

[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
