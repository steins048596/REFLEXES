        "note": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLong-standing iron deficiency anemia.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Christina Cooper, born on 07/01/1954, is a new patient who presents with a long-standing history of iron deficiency anemia. She recently attempted to donate blood in December and was informed that she was anemic. This was not the first time she had been diagnosed with anemia, which has been an ongoing issue since she was 13. \n\nMs. Cooper has been experiencing fatigue, chills, breathlessness, wheezing, headaches, and heightened anxiety and depression. She has a history of heavy periods until her hysterectomy in 1996. She had a normal colonoscopy five to six years ago and doesn't have any known history of sleep apnea, pacemaker use, or use of oxygen at night. She drinks alcohol only once or twice a year.\n\nShe has recently started taking 25 mg of ferrous sulfate twice daily and over-the-counter vitamin B12. \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n? Constitutional: Endorses fatigue and chills.\n? Cardiovascular: Endorses breathlessness and wheezing.\n? Neurological: Endorses headaches.\n? Psychiatric: Endorses increased anxiety and depression.\n? Gastrointestinal: No recent history of GI bleeds.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n? Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds.\n? Pulmonary: Breath sounds normal.\n? Abdomen: Soft, non-tender with no organomegaly.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRecent blood work revealed low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs with low ferritin.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nMs. Christina Cooper is a 69-year-old female with a long-standing history of iron deficiency anemia. \n\nIron deficiency anemia.\n? Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of heavy periods until her hysterectomy, history of anemia since her teenage years, and low ferritin on recent labs, her anemia is likely due to iron deficiency. \n? Medical Treatment: She has been asked to continue ferrous sulfate 25mg twice daily along with vitamin B12. To enhance iron absorption, she has been advised to take the iron pills with orange juice.\n? Additional Testing: A recheck of CBC, iron, ferritin, B12, and folate will be conducted after 12 weeks.\n? Specialist Referrals: An upper endoscopy and colonoscopy have been planned to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If the results are inconclusive, a capsule endoscopy will be considered. A referral has also been sent to a hematologist to assess whether intravenous iron or other treatments to help her body store iron better are necessary.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan. She will schedule her upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, and appointment with the hematologist. She will follow the bowel prep instructions and will reach out with any questions or worsening symptoms."

Do not make up information.\n\nEXAMPLE NOTE:\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHypogonadism.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient\u2019s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.\n\nThe patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.\n\nCurrently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.\n\nMr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life \"together.\" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHIV\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nUtilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.\nActively trying to get his life together.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nCialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.\nFinasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.\nTestosterone cypionate 140 mg.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPSA 0.6 ng/mL.\nTriglycerides 145 mg/dL.\nTotal testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n? Hypogonadism.\n\nPLAN\n\nI recommend maintaining current management. The patient\u2019s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it\u2019s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.\n\nI provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.\n\nDIALOGUE: [doctor] patient , bruce ward . date of birth 5/21/1969 . please use my neuro consult template . this is a 52-year-old male with dia- newly diagnosed pituitary lesion . the patient is seen in consultation at the request of dr. henry howard for possible surgical intervention . mr . ward presented to his primary care provider , dr. howard , on 3/1/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months . he denied any trouble with headaches in the past . his past clinical history is unremarkable .\n[doctor] worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted .\n[doctor] hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores .\n[patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you .\n[doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ?\n[patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .\n[doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ?\n[patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .\n[doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ?\n[patient] well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .\n[doctor] okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ?

        "note": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHeadaches and a newly discovered pituitary lesion.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBruce Ward, a 52-year-old male, presents for a neurosurgical consultation due to a pituitary lesion discovered during a workup for chronic headaches. The patient first reported these worsening headaches to his primary care provider, Dr. Henry Howard, on 03/01/2023. The headaches were new for the patient and described as located behind the eyes, with a dull, nagging quality, worsening over the past three months. Initially, the pain severity was 3 out of 10, which has now escalated to a 6 out of 10. The headaches typically present in the morning, lasting for a few hours, with no identifiable triggers or alleviating factors. The patient denies any additional symptoms, including nausea, fever, rashes, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or syncope. However, he did mention recent incidents of bumping into door frames.\n\nOn further evaluation, a brain MRI revealed a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The patient's complete blood count, urea, coagulation, and C-reactive protein results were normal. However, his pituitary hormone profile showed a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nThe patient has no known chronic illnesses, takes no medications, and has no known familial history of disease due to his adoption.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient works as a computer programmer, is married for 25 years, and recently purchased a house. He denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substance use.\n\nEXAMINATION\n\nThe patient was alert, oriented, and had fluent speech. The cranial nerve examination was grossly intact with no focal, motor, or sensory deficits observed in the upper or lower extremities. Visual acuity and eye movements were normal, pupils were equal and reactive, but visual field testing revealed bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision was reported as normal.\n\nDIAGNOSIS\n\nPituitary adenoma.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nMr. Ward's condition presents as a benign appearing pituitary adenoma. The patient is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression due to the pituitary lesion. \n\nPLAN\n\nGiven the symptoms and the findings from the MRI, surgical intervention is recommended for excision and decompression of the pituitary fossa. The patient was informed about the transsphenoidal surgical approach and associated risks, including anesthesia, infection, need for further surgery, wound complications, seizures, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, and possible death. A pre-surgery visual field test was also planned for mapping peripheral vision, enabling post-surgery comparison and monitoring. The patient was referred to the surgery scheduler and to an ophthalmologist for a detailed eye examination. \n\nMr. Ward understands the need for surgery and is scheduled to meet with the surgery scheduler to plan the procedure. The patient will be encouraged to contact the clinic if he has further questions or concerns. End of note."

Do not make up information.\n\nEXAMPLE NOTE:\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nRoger Nelson is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up for chest pain. The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and a full chest pain for approximately hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.\n\nThe patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.\n\nHis blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nNeck\n? General Examination: I do feel a little large thyroid that is not tender. She has a carotid bruit on the right side. \n\nRespiratory\n? Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. Cardiovascular\n? Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, but I do hear 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Gastrointestinal\n? Examination of Abdomen: Soft. There is a healed scar on the right knee from prior knee surgery. Musculoskeletal\n? Examination: There is no lower extremity edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBlood pressure is elevated.\n\nEKG is normal.\n\nEchocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nThe patient is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up. He presented to the emergency room for chest pain and elevated blood pressure of 180/95. His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.\n\nChest pain and hypertension.\n? Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.\n? Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nDIALOGUE: [doctor] next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ?\n[patient] good morning . yes . that's me .\n[doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you .\n[patient] nice to meet you too .\n[doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ?\n[patient] well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then .\n[doctor] okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ?\n[patient] um , early october .\n[doctor] of 2020 , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?\n[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .\n[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?\n[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .\n[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?\n[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .\n[doctor] okay . i see .\n[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .\n[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?\n[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .\n[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?\n[patient] yes . with eating .\n[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?\n[patient] mm-hmm . i did .\n[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?\n[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .\n[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .\n[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .\n[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?\n[patient] they're normal .\n[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?\n[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .\n[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?\n[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .\n[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?\n[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .\n[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?\n[patient] i'd say it's about the same .\n[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .\n[patient] okay . good .\n[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .\n[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .\n[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?\n[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .\n[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .\n[patient] no . that's it . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .\nCLINICAL NOTE:\n        ",

The pain was centered behind her breastbone, sharp in nature, and exacerbated with eating. She also reported difficulty swallowing during this period. The patient had a negative workup in the ER including normal EKG and blood tests. She denies recurrent symptoms since that time. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n? Abdominal Examination: Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants. No pain or tenderness in lower belly. No other abnormalities were noted.\n\nRESULTS\n\nNormal cardiac workup from ER records.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nThe patient is a 55-year-old female who presents with a history of a short-lived episode of chest pain and dysphagia, presumed to be esophagitis per ER evaluation, though currently asymptomatic. Multiple potential etiologies have been considered including GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal causes, and anxiety, given her stressful job transition during the same period.\n\nMedical Reasoning: Given the transient nature of her symptoms, as well as her lack of ongoing discomfort, it is possible that the patient experienced an anxiety-related episode in conjunction with some GI involvement, possibly esophagitis. \n\nMedical Plan: It was suggested that an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) could be conducted to evaluate her esophagus and stomach, however, considering the patient has been asymptomatic for three months, and esophagitis would likely be healed by now, it may not provide additional diagnostic value. The patient agreed to self-monitor her symptoms and contact the clinic with any recurrence or change in symptoms. Regular follow-ups as needed were also recommended.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the proposed plan to monitor her symptoms and reach out in case of recurrence. She agreed to delay the EGD unless her symptoms reoccur or change."

She is under the care of multiple specialists including a gastroenterologist, dietitian, allergist, neurologist, orthopedist, and ophthalmologist. \n\nThe patient's mother states that Katherine was born premature with a birth weight of 4 pounds 8 ounces, compared to her twin who weighed 3 pounds 13 ounces. She reports that Katherine had difficulties feeding and maintaining her body temperature at birth. Currently, Katherine is starting to crawl and take steps, which indicates developmental progress. She is involved in feeding, occupational, and physical therapy and will soon start speech therapy.\n\nKatherine has been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux, which is managed with dietary changes including removing cow's milk from her diet. According to her mother, Katherine drinks a lot, mostly pea protein milk, water, and diluted juice. She produces approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers per day.\n\nThe patient's mother is particularly concerned about potential kidney issues associated with SMS, as mentioned by their geneticist. They are visiting today to ensure that Katherine's kidneys are functioning well.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n? General: Well-nourished female, slightly fussy during the exam.

Do not make up information.\n\nEXAMPLE NOTE:\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight ankle pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAnna Diaz is a pleasant 31-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right ankle pain. The onset of her pain began when she slipped on a patch of ice while taking out the trash. She states that she heard a pop at the time of the injury. The patient reports that she was unable to ambulate on her right ankle initially after the injury; however, she is now able to bear some weight on her right ankle, but she is still limping. The patient rates her pain level as a 6 out of 10. Ms. Diaz describes her pain as constant and throbbing. She reports that her right ankle is warm to the touch. She denies any numbness or tingling in her right foot. The patient has been icing and elevating her right ankle while also utilizing ibuprofen last night and this morning, which did not provide her with any relief. The patient states that she used to play a lot of soccer in high school so she notes that she has had other right foot injuries but not like this.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Positive right ankle pain.\nSkin: Positive warmth to the right foot.\nNeurological: Denies any numbness or tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nBP: 120/80\nSPO2: 98%.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.\nNEURO: Normal sensation. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.\nMSK: Examination of the right ankle reveals ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with swelling. Tenderness to palpation anterolaterally in the soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer or inversion stress. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the right ankle taken in office today reveals no fracture or bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight ankle sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have advised her to keep her right leg elevated when she is seated. I have also advised her to ice her right ankle 5 times per day for 20 minutes at a time to help with the swelling. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in an Aircast to stabilize the ankle. She will remain non-weight-bearing for 1 to 2 days, we provided her with crutches today, and then she can begin weight-bearing as tolerated.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf her pain does not improve over the

looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well\n[patient] yeah it does\n[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like\n[patient] not without extreme pain\n[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick

radial deviation hurt\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright and then lateral as well\n[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason\n[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist\n[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight\n[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you\n[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all\n[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down\n[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better\n[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] pardon what\n[patient] a what\n[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay\n[patient] when do i have to have the surgery\n[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so what\n[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace\n[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks\n[patient] six weeks\n[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of\n[patient] oof\n[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions\n[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so\n[doctor] okay how long is the vacation\n[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks\n[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks\n[patient] no vacation in a month\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] no problem bye\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present\nCLINICAL NOTE:\n        ",

alright so we will take a look i'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly\n[patient] yes i have\n[doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that\n[patient] i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes\n[doctor] okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today\n[patient] no\n[doctor] are you any belly pain\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no shortness of breath just wan na make sure\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so i'm just gon na listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any wheezes or crackles listen to your heart so

the knee and some effusion you have a little bit of fluid in there as well so prior to coming in we did do an x-ray of that right knee and luckily you did n't break anything so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have what we call a mcl strain so a medial collateral ligament strain so when you fell i think you twisted a little bit and so it irritated you strained that that ligament there so for that what we can do for you first i'm gon na prescribe you some ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams and you can take that twice a day and that's gon na help you with that swelling and that pain that you currently do have i'm also gon na put you in a a knee brace just to try and support those muscles to allow it to heal and then i want you to ice the knee you can do that for twenty minutes at a time for three to four times a day that should also help with the the swelling of your knee for your hypertension now i'm gon na keep you on that twenty of lisinopril okay because you are taking it and you you're doing pretty good with it i also want to get you a referral to nutrition just to try to help you with that

Do not make up information.\n\nEXAMPLE NOTE:\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft shoulder pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAlan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.\n\nThe patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nAll vital signs are within the normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.\n\nDIALOGUE: [doctor] hi wayne how're you today\n[patient] i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having\n[doctor] okay and how long have you had this

The onset of her pain began 2 weeks ago, when she was downhill skiing. She states she ran into a tree and twisted her right knee. At the time of the injury, she also heard a pop in her left knee, however she denies left knee pain. The patient locates her pain to the medial aspect of her right knee. Currently, her pain level is 7 out of 10, however she notes this can reach an 11 out of 10 at times with prolonged ambulation. The patient states that her pain has been slowly increasing over the last few days. She experiences limping with ambulation. The patient states that her pain lasts for as long as she is ambulating. She denies radiating pain. She also reports constant swelling and stiffness in the morning. Her stiffness will resolve with ambulation. The patient has been wearing a brace and using THC cream, which has been helpful. She denies taking any medications for pain, however she has been utilizing THC gummies, which have been beneficial.\n\nThe patient has a history of a right knee reconstruction when she was 14 years old. She states that she was a good gymnast at that time. The patient adds that she has had problems with her right knee since that time. She denies any other exercises outside of intense gym and ski events.

I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.\n\nRegarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.\n\nDIALOGUE: [doctor] okay hi andrea well i\n[patient] hello\n[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can

The issue is intermittent in nature, occurring less than once a day, often when she is walking. She describes the sensation as her knee \"giving out\" and sometimes feels as though she might fall, although she is able to catch herself. She has not experienced any particular trauma to the knee or heard any popping sounds. The discomfort is brief, subsiding as quickly as it begins, hence she has not felt the need to take any pain medication. Despite this, she reports needing to use a grocery cart for support while shopping. She has been avoiding activities that may exacerbate her condition, such as line dancing, which she will be unable to participate in during her upcoming trip to a Lion's Club function due to her knee issue.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nAndrea is currently on Farxiga, Amlodipine, Lisinopril, Hydrochlorothiazide, and Metformin for her hypertension and diabetes.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports intermittent left knee instability. \n\nCardiovascular: Taking medications for hypertension, blood pressure stable.\n\nEndocrine: Diabetes mellitus, reports slightly elevated morning blood sugars.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Left knee examination revealed no ecchymosis or edema, no effusion, no pain to palpation of the left medial knee.

For her left knee instability, I have prescribed meloxicam 15 mg daily and recommended physical therapy to strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee and to prevent further instability. For her hypertension, we will continue with her current medication regimen and order an echocardiogram to evaluate her heart murmur. Regarding her diabetes, I have ordered a hemoglobin A1c test to assess her glucose control and will also order a lipid panel. Andrea has been informed and agreed with the plan. She has no further questions at this time. We will schedule her for the echocardiogram and further tests."

cough\n[patient] more dry\n[doctor] a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat\n[patient] this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it

and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there\n[patient] no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would\n[doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems\n[patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong\n[doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone\n[patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me\n[doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue\n[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming\n[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far\n[patient] that sounds great thank you\n[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss\n[patient] great\n[doctor] okay any questions for me\n[patient] i do n't believe so at this time\n[doctor] okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit\n[patient] great thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome and so now just\nCLINICAL NOTE:\n        ",

Recurrent lung infections.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms seem consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He is a farmer and has been moving hay quite frequently recently.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed with the patient. I explained that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be caused by bacteria and/or mold that is found in the hay. We discussed that when inhaling this, it leads to an allergic reaction in the lungs, which would explain why symptoms occur every time he moves hay. He was advised that it would be best to eliminate his exposure to hay in order to prevent further damage to his lungs, however, if he is unable to do this then it would be recommended that he wear a respirator when working. Questions were invited and answered today.\n- Medical Treatment: A course of oral steroids were prescribed today to help decrease his lung inflammation. CT of the lungs will also be ordered today to confirm the diagnosis. A pulmonary function test was also ordered to assess the severity of his respiratory impairment.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment

abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today\n[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding\n[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me\n[patient] yeah that's a mouthful\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here\n[doctor] i'll do this\n[patient] i i think i would break that\n[doctor] yeah i just saw that\n[patient] if you can do that\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up\n[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me\n[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections\n[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual\n[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections\n[doctor] diarrhea no\n[patient] frequently\n[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of\n[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies\n[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy\n[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions\n[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes\n[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street\n[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes\n[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that\n[doctor] i know i know\n[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away\n[doctor] right\n[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products\n[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally\n[patient] okay where did you go\n[doctor] i was in zambia\n[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful\n[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time\n[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial\n[doctor] no\n[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you\n[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried\n[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea\n[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and\n[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency\n[doctor] why is that\n[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency\n[doctor] okay okay thank you\n[patient] you're welcome\n[doctor] okay\nCLINICAL NOTE:\n        ",

The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nVitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right side.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe CT scan of the abdomen revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight kidney stone.\n\nPLAN\n\nWe reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress.

He complains of intermittent sharp pain localized on the right side of his abdomen below his ribs that radiates to his lower abdomen and into his groin. His symptoms started several days ago. He also reports dysuria (burning sensation during urination) and slightly darker urine, although he denies seeing frank blood in his urine. His pain is severe enough to cause discomfort, and over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol have provided little relief.

He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.\n\nHe is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.\n\nIn terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of diabetes and heart disease.

There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot\n2. Diabetes\n3. Coronary artery disease\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.\n\nThe patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.\n\nDIALOGUE: [doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that\n[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it\n[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics\n[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left\n[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now\n[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point\n[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that\n[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc\n[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park\n[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now\n[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there\n[patient] i do n't feel that right there\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure\n[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture\n[doctor] correct\n[patient] if i heard\n[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy\n[patient] okay sounds good\n[doctor] alright\nCLINICAL NOTE:\n        ",
        "note": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nNon-healing right foot ulcer.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nNicholas, a patient with a known history of diabetes, presents with a non-healing right foot ulcer. The patient first noticed the ulcer approximately six weeks ago after wearing tight shoes. He initially experienced burning and stinging sensations, and discovered a blister on the pad of the bottom of his foot, near his heel. \n\nOver time, he noticed a foul smell and yellow drainage from the site. After consultation with his primary care provider (PCP), the patient started antibiotic therapy six days ago. His symptoms include intermittent chills, a fever of around 99.7\u00b0F, and pain radiating up his calf. The patient reports that the ulcer site has turned black and the area is excessively hot. He has also experienced coughing and breathlessness over the past two days.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient has a medical history of well-controlled diabetes with an A1C of 6.7. He checks his blood sugar levels two to three times a day and has had blood sugar readings in the range of 300-400 mg/dl over the past two weeks, with a spike up to 500-600 mg/dl. The patient is a keen hiker, using specialized diabetic shoes and inserts.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient does not report any surgical history.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient is an active individual who enjoys hiking. \n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient has been on antibiotics for the past six days. \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports fever and chills.\nCardiovascular: Reports calf pain.\nRespiratory: Reports cough and shortness of breath.\nSkin: Patient reports non-healing right foot ulcer with necrotic tissue and foul-smelling yellow drainage.\nNeurological: No abnormalities reported.\n\nVITALS\n\nSlight fever detected.\nBlood pressure: Within normal range.\nHeart rate: Not specified.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Not specified.\nRESPIRATORY: Not specified.\nNECK: Not specified.\nMSK: Examination of the right foot reveals a 2 x 2 cm necrotic wound on the heel with surrounding erythema and cellulitis. There is no bony exposure. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable, but are present via doppler.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot\n2. Diabetes\n3. Possible cellulitis\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter examining the patient's foot, a plan was formulated to address his non-healing foot ulcer. An arterial study will be ordered to assess the blood supply to the wound. Debridement will be performed in-office today and a culture will be taken from the wound to assess for possible infection. His antibiotic regimen will be continued, with potential changes or additions depending on the culture results. The patient will be seen again in one week for a follow-up.\n\nThe patient has been advised to consult with his endocrinologist to ensure that his diabetes is managed effectively during this period. This includes closely monitoring his blood sugar levels due to the ongoing medication therapy for the foot ulcer. The patient agreed with the plan and had no additional questions or concerns at this time."

your favorite type of pie\n[patient] well you know it's favorite boy i just like pie you know apples cherry chocolate you know bicon\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i try to try to avoid the bicon because i

time\n[doctor] okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly\n[patient] i try to\n[doctor] okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or\n[patient] yeah it's definitely running below that\n[doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below\n[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty\n[doctor] good\n[patient] pretty regular\n[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press\n[patient] it's a little bit sore\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all\n[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel\n[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day\n[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so\n[doctor] do you have any questions about that\n[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just\n[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this\n[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing\n[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound\n[patient] that's fine\n[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound\n[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues\n[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable\n[patient] okay that'd be good\n[doctor] okay anything else\n[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave\n[doctor] well you know where to find me okay\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] take care bye\nCLINICAL NOTE:\n        ",
